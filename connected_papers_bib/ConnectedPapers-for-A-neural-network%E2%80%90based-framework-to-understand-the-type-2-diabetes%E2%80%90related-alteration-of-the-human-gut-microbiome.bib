abstract = {Background:Gut microbial gene richness and specific bacterial species are associated with metabolic risk markers in humans, but the impact of host physiology and dietary habits on the link between the gut microbiota and metabolic markers remain unclear. The objective of this study was to identify gut metagenomic markers associated with estimates of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammation in obesity, and to explore whether the associations between metagenomic and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for body fat, age and habitual dietary intake.Methods:Faecal DNA from 53 women with obesity was analysed through quantitative metagenomic sequencing and analysis, and a systematic search was performed for bacterial genes associated with estimates of insulin resistance, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Subsequently, the correlations between metagenomic species and metabolic markers were tested by linear regression models, with and without covariate adjustment.Results:One hundred and fourteen metagenomic species correlated with metabolic markers (P<0.001) including Akkermansia muciniphila, Bilophila wadsworthia, Bifidobacterium longum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but also species not previously associated with metabolic markers including Bacteroides faecis and Dorea longicatena. The majority of the identified correlations between bacterial species and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for differences in body fat, age and dietary macronutrient composition; however, the negative correlation with insulin resistance observed for B. longum and F. prausnitzii appeared to be modified by the intake of dietary fibre and fat, respectively.Conclusions:This study shows that several gut bacterial species are linked to metabolic risk markers in obesity, also after adjustment for potential confounders, such as long-term diet composition. The study supports the use of gut metagenomic markers for metabolic disease prediction and warrants further investigation of causality.},

Here, the gut microbiota was analyzed via metagenomic sequencing, and the fluctuations in the gut microbiota under the conditions of spaceflight were characterized. The composition and function of the gut microbiota were substantially affected by spaceflight; however, individual specificity was uncompromised. We further confirmed the species fluctuations and functional genes from both missions. Resistance and virulence genes in the gut microbiota were affected by spaceflight, but the species attributions remained stable. Spaceflight markedly affected the composition and function of the human gut microbiota, implying that the human gut microbiota is sensitive to spaceflight.},

abstract = {Abstract Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and other secondary complications, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, etc. The important risk factors for the pathogenesis of DM are aging, family history, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary habits, and obesity. Evidence from epidemiological studies also indicates that DM is characterized by specific alterations in the human gut microbiota (GM). GM transplantation in rodents and humans revealed that a specific GM constituent can be the cause and not just the consequence of the DM condition and complications. These findings suggest a potential role of GM in human health, disease prevention, and treatment. Dietary intervention studies using dietary fibers (DFs) suggested that modulation of the GM can suppress the metabolic risk markers in humans. However, a causal role of GM in such studies remains unexplored. Long-term follow-up studies disclosed that the diet rich in insoluble and non-viscous fibers are responsible for DF-mediated antidiabetic activities, while soluble and viscous fibers have little influence on DM despite having a profound impact on glycemia. However, general conclusions cannot be drawn simply based on these findings. Long-term follow-up studies are urgently required in this area to explore the therapeutic potential of different DFs in treating DM and to delineate the exact role of GM involvement. Here we review and discuss the signature of GM during DM, antidiabetic activity of metformin via GM modulation, DFs from different sources and their antidiabetic activity, and the possible role of GM involvement.},

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.},

abstract = {Differences in the presence of even a few genes between otherwise identical bacterial strains may result in critical phenotypic differences. Here we systematically identify microbial genomic structural variants (SVs) and find them to be prevalent in the human gut microbiome across phyla and to replicate in different cohorts. SVs are enriched for CRISPR-associated and antibiotic-producing functions and depleted from housekeeping genes, suggesting that they have a role in microbial adaptation. We find multiple associations between SVs and host disease risk factors, many of which replicate in an independent cohort. Exploring genes that are clustered in the same SV, we uncover several possible mechanistic links between the microbiome and its host, including a region in Anaerostipes hadrus that encodes a composite inositol catabolism-butyrate biosynthesis pathway, the presence of which is associated with lower host metabolic disease risk. Overall, our results uncover a nascent layer of variability in the microbiome that is associated with microbial adaptation and host health.The authors systematically characterize structural variation in the genomes of gut microbiota and show that they are associated with bacterial fitness and with host risk factors, and that examining genes coded in these regions facilitates investigation of mechanisms that may underlie these associations.},

abstract = {Microbiota of the wild blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) presents a seasonal variation due to different dietary selection and feeding strategies from different ecological niches chosen by different sex in summer. To address those issues, we analyzed the variation of gut microbiota based on the material from the feces, with 16S rRNA and meta-genome aimed to explore seasonal and gender differences. The results indicate that seasonal dietary changes and gender differentiation, as expected, cause the variation in sheep’s gut microbiota structure. The variation of the former is more significant than the latter. Dominant Firmicutes exists a significantly higher abundance in summer than that in winter. Subordinate Bacteroides expresses no seasonal difference between the two seasons. Compared with the winter group, the summer group is featured by abundant enzymes digesting cellulose and generating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as beta-glucosidase (EC: 3.2.1.21) for cellulose digestion, and butyrate kinase (EC:2.7.2.7) in butyrate metabolism, implying that the changes of the composition in intestinal flora allow the sheep to adapt to the seasonalized dietary selection through alternated microbial functions to reach the goal of facilitating the efficiency of energy harvesting. The results also show that the blue sheep expresses a prominent sexual dimorphism in the components of gut microbiota, indicating that the two sexes have different adaptations to the dietary selection, and demands for physical and psychological purposes. Thus, this study provides an example of demonstrating the principles and regulations of natural selection and environmental adaptation.},

Despite widespread antibiotic use, our understanding of the species and metabolic functions contributing to gut microbiome recovery is limited. Using data from 4 discovery cohorts in 3 continents comprising >500 microbiome profiles from 117 individuals, we identified 21 bacterial species exhibiting robust association with ecological recovery post antibiotic therapy. Functional and growth-rate analysis showed that recovery is supported by enrichment in specific carbohydrate-degradation and energy-production pathways. Association rule mining on 782 microbiome profiles from the MEDUSA database enabled reconstruction of the gut microbial ‘food web’, identifying many recovery-associated bacteria as keystone species, with the ability to use host- and diet-derived energy sources, and support repopulation of other gut species. Experiments in a mouse model recapitulated the ability of recovery-associated bacteria ( Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis ) to promote recovery with synergistic effects, providing a boost of two orders of magnitude to microbial abundance in early time points and faster maturation of microbial diversity. The identification of specific species and metabolic functions promoting recovery opens up opportunities for rationally determining pre- and probiotic formulations offering protection from long-term consequences of frequent antibiotic usage. Discovery cohorts from three continents, plus experiments in mouse models, are used to identify microbial species and mechanisms involved in post-antibiotic gut community recovery.},

Using these markers, the NN model obtains higher accuracy in classifying the T2D-related samples than machine learning-based approaches. The NN-based regression analysis determines the fasting blood glucose (FBG) is the most significant association factor (P<<0.05) in the T2D-related alteration of the gut microbiome. Twenty-four marker species that vary little across the case and control samples and are often neglected by the statistic-based methods greatly shift in different stages of the T2D development, implying that the cumulative effect of the markers rather than individuals likely drives the alteration of the gut microbiome.},

abstract = {Comparing metagenomic samples is crucial for understanding microbial communities. For different groups of microbial communities, such as human gut metagenomic samples from patients with a certain disease and healthy controls, identifying group-specific sequences offers essential information for potential biomarker discovery. A sequence that is present, or rich, in one group, but absent, or scarce, in another group is considered “group-specific” in our study. Our main purpose is to discover group-specific sequence regions between control and case groups as disease-associated markers. We developed a long k-mer (k ≥ 30 bps)-based computational pipeline to detect group-specific sequences at strain resolution free from reference sequences, sequence alignments, and metagenome-wide de novo assembly. We called our method MetaGO: Group-specific oligonucleotide analysis for metagenomic samples. An open-source pipeline on Apache Spark was developed with parallel computing. We applied MetaGO to one simulated and three real metagenomic datasets to evaluate the discriminative capability of identified group-specific markers. In the simulated dataset, 99.11% of group-specific logical 40-mers covered 98.89% disease-specific regions from the disease-associated strain. In addition, 97.90% of group-specific numerical 40-mers covered 99.61 and 96.39% of differentially abundant genome and regions between two groups, respectively. For a large-scale metagenomic liver cirrhosis (LC)-associated dataset, we identified 37,647 group-specific 40-mer features. Any one of the features can predict disease status of the training samples with the average of sensitivity and specificity higher than 0.8. The random forests classification using the top 10 group-specific features yielded a higher AUC (from ∼0.8 to ∼0.9) than that of previous studies. All group-specific 40-mers were present in LC patients, but not healthy controls. All the assembled 11 LC-specific sequences can be mapped to two strains of Veillonella parvula: UTDB1-3 and DSM2008. The experiments on the other two real datasets related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Type 2 Diabetes in Women consistently demonstrated that MetaGO achieved better prediction accuracy with fewer features compared to previous studies. The experiments showed that MetaGO is a powerful tool for identifying group-specific k-mers, which would be clinically applicable for disease prediction.

We conducted a 90-day controlled open-label trial to evaluate the health improvement ability of a specially designed diet, and the diet combined with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). According to our study, both diet and diet plus FMT treatments showed great potential in controlling blood glucose and blood pressure levels. Sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiniSeq platform revealed a shift of intestinal microbial community in T2D patients, and the changes were also observed in response to the treatments. FMT changed the gut microbiota more quickly than diet. Beneficial bacterium, such as Bifidobacterium , increased along the study and was negatively correlated with blood glucose, blood pressure, blood lipid and BMI. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), Bilophila and Desulfovibrio , decreased significantly after treatment, showed a positive correlation with blood glucose indices. Thus, the specially designed diet is beneficial to improve blood glucose control in diabetic patients, it also showed the potential to reverse dyslipidemia and dysarteriotony.},

Blastocystis spp. commonly colonize the gut, but its clinical significance and ecological role are currently unsettled. We have developed a high-sensitivity bioinformatic pipeline to detect Blastocystis subtypes (STs) from shotgun metagenomics, and applied it to 12 large data sets, comprising 1689 subjects of different geographic origin, disease status and lifestyle. We confirmed and extended previous observations on the high prevalence the microrganism in the population (14.9%), its non-random and ST-specific distribution, and its ability to cause persistent (asymptomatic) colonization. These findings, along with the higher prevalence observed in non-westernized individuals, the lack of positive association with any of the disease considered, and decreased presence in individuals with dysbiosis associated with colorectal cancer and Crohn’s disease, strongly suggest that Blastocystis is a component of the healthy gut microbiome. Further, we found an inverse association between body mass index and Blastocystis, and strong co-occurrence with archaeal organisms (Methanobrevibacter smithii) and several bacterial species. The association of specific microbial community structures with Blastocystis was confirmed by the high predictability (up to 0.91 area under the curve) of the microorganism colonization based on the species-level composition of the microbiome. Finally, we reconstructed and functionally profiled 43 new draft Blastocystis genomes and discovered a higher intra subtype variability of ST1 and ST2 compared with ST3 and ST4. Altogether, we provide an in-depth epidemiologic, ecological, and genomic analysis of Blastocystis, and show how metagenomics can be crucial to advance population genomics of human parasites.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence has indicated an association between the gut microbiome and arthritis diseases including gout. This metagenomic study aims to investigate the possible role of gut microbiota in the development of gout. The results exhibit gout patients have higher abundance of Prevotella, Fusobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp., whereas healthy controls have higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae spp., butyrate-producing species, including Roseburia spp., Butyrivibrio spp. and Coprococcus spp. and anti-inflammatory Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Functional analysis shows gut microbiome of gout patients have higher potential for fructose, mannose metabolism and lipid A biosynthesis, but lower potential for urate degradation and SCFAs production. Enterobacteriaceae spp. may contribute to urate degradation and provide immunostimulatory effect in healthy controls. A disease classifier based on gut microbiota shows positive performance in the discovery and validation cohorts (93.03% and 89.13% accuracy, respectively). The effect of uric-acid-lowering and anti-inflammatory drugs on the gut microbiome is mild. Integrative analyses of four additional diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis) indicates gout seems to be more similar to autoimmune diseases than metabolic diseases. This work demonstrates an altered gut microbiota might influence the development of gout and provides new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.},

abstract = {The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem, in which hundreds of microbial species and metabolites coexist, in part due to an extensive network of cross-feeding interactions. However, both the large-scale trophic organization of this ecosystem, and its effects on the underlying metabolic flow, remain unexplored. Here, using a simplified model, we provide quantitative support for a multi-level trophic organization of the human gut microbiome, where microbes consume and secrete metabolites in multiple iterative steps. Using a manually-curated set of metabolic interactions between microbes, our model suggests about four trophic levels, each characterized by a high level-to-level metabolic transfer of byproducts. It also quantitatively predicts the typical metabolic environment of the gut (fecal metabolome) in approximate agreement with the real data. To understand the consequences of this trophic organization, we quantify the metabolic flow and biomass distribution, and explore patterns of microbial and metabolic diversity in different levels. The hierarchical trophic organization suggested by our model can help mechanistically establish causal links between the abundances of microbes and metabolites in the human gut.},

abstract = {Analyses in mice and humans indicate that non-caloric artificial sweeteners may promote obesity-associated metabolic changes by changing the function of the bacteria that colonize the gut. See Article p.181
 We have been using non-caloric artificial sweeteners for more than a century. Today the food industry is using them in ever-greater quantities in 'diet' foodstuffs and they are recommended for weight loss and for individuals with glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eran Elinav and colleagues show that consumption of the three most commonly used non-caloric artificial sweeteners — saccharin, sucralose and aspartame — directly induces a propensity for obesity and glucose intolerance in mice. These effects are mediated by changes in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota; deleterious metabolic effects can be transferred to germ-free mice by faecal transplantation and can be abrogated by antibiotic treatment. The authors demonstrate that artificial sweeteners can induce dysbiosis and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects, and suggest that it may be necessary to develop new nutritional strategies tailored to the individual and to variations in the gut microbiota.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the protective effect of Polyethylene Glycol Loxenatide Injection (Glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1) on endothelial cells from middle-aged and elderly patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GLP-1 weekly formulation was analyzed for cardiovascular disease protection and correlated with intestinal flora. Design: Stool samples were collected from middle-aged and elderly patients with new-onset or poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in Longhu People’s Hospital and Shantou Central Hospital from June 2019 to November 2019. Samples were collected at week 0, 4, and 8 of treatment with GLP-1 weekly formulations. Samples were analyzed for metagenomic sequencing. Analysis was performed to compare the characteristics of the gut microbiota at week 0, 4, and 8 of GLP-1 treatment and to correlate different microbiota with characteristic clinical parameters. Results: Statistical differences were found in blood glucose lowering, cardiovascular endothelial, and inflammation-related indices between week 0 and W4 and in blood glucose lowering and cardiovascular endothelial indices from week 0 to 8 in the newly diagnosed or poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients treated with GLP-1. Changes in gut microbiota at week 0, 4, and 8 after using GLP-1 were not statistically different, but had an overall trend of rising and then falling, and with different bacteria, that were correlated with different clinical indicators. Conclusion: GLP-1 improves endothelial cell function indicators in middle-aged and elderly diabetic patients, which may be related to its alteration of the population numbers of gut microbiota such as Acinetobacter, Eubacterium ramulus ATCC 29099, and Bacteroides_faecis. This study provides a guidance for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients.},

Here, in 39 medication-naive men with prediabetes, we found that exercise-induced alterations in the gut microbiota correlated closely with improvements in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (clinicaltrials.gov entry NCT03240978). The microbiome of responders exhibited an enhanced capacity for biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acids and catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, whereas those of non-responders were characterized by increased production of metabolically detrimental compounds. Fecal microbial transplantation from responders, but not non-responders, mimicked the effects of exercise on alleviation of insulin resistance in obese mice. Furthermore, a machine-learning algorithm integrating baseline microbial signatures accurately predicted personalized glycemic response to exercise in an additional 30 subjects. These findings raise the possibility of maximizing the benefits of exercise by targeting the gut microbiota.},

Therefore, we analyzed the gut microbial profiles of central obese individuals with or without T2D from a Chinese population. Here we reported both the microbial compositional and gene functional alterations during the progression from central obesity to T2D. Several opportunistic pathogens were enriched in obese T2D patients. We also characterized thousands of genes involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism whose abundance were significantly depleted in obese T2D group. Moreover, the abundance of those genes was negatively associated with plasma glycemia level and percentage of individuals with impaired plasma glucose status. Therefore, our study indicates that the abundance of those depleted genes can be used as a potential biomarker to identify central obese individuals with high risks of developing T2D.},

abstract = {Human gut microbiota is a complex community of organisms including trillions of bacteria. While these microorganisms are considered as essential regulators of our immune system, some of them can cause several diseases. In recent years, next-generation sequencing technologies accelerated the discovery of human gut microbiota. In this respect, the use of machine learning techniques became popular to analyze disease-associated metagenomics datasets. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease and affects millions of people around the world. Since the early diagnosis in T2D is important for effective treatment, there is an utmost need to develop a classification technique that can accelerate T2D diagnosis. In this study, using T2D-associated metagenomics data, we aim to develop a classification model to facilitate T2D diagnosis and to discover T2D-associated biomarkers. The sequencing data of T2D patients and healthy individuals were taken from a metagenome-wide association study and categorized into disease states. The sequencing reads were assigned to taxa, and the identified species are used to train and test our model. To deal with the high dimensionality of features, we applied robust feature selection algorithms such as Conditional Mutual Information Maximization, Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy, Correlation Based Feature Selection, and select K best approach. To test the performance of the classification based on the features that are selected by different methods, we used random forest classifier with 100-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation. In our experiments, we observed that 15 commonly selected features have a considerable effect in terms of minimizing the microbiota used for the diagnosis of T2D and thus reducing the time and cost. When we perform biological validation of these identified species, we found that some of them are known as related to T2D development mechanisms and we identified additional species as potential biomarkers. Additionally, we attempted to find the subgroups of T2D patients using k-means clustering. In summary, this study utilizes several supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to increase the diagnostic accuracy of T2D, investigates potential biomarkers of T2D, and finds out which subset of microbiota is more informative than other taxa by applying state-of-the art feature selection methods.},

Ageing-associated microbiome alterations towards a disease-like configuration occur in colorectal cancer patients, thereby masking disease signatures. We identified a microbiome disease response shared across multiple diseases in elderly subjects that is distinct from that in young/middle-aged individuals, but also a novel set of taxa consistently gained in disease across all age groups. A subset of these taxa was associated with increased frailty in subjects from the ELDERMET cohort.

Despite general interest in microbiome health, it is not known how microbial biomarkers from metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS) would perform in a cohort of young individuals, who would be largely free of chronic diseases, as well as medication. Here we analyze high-depth fecal metagenomic shotgun sequencing for 2183 healthy adults with clinical parameters, diet, lifestyle, and metabolite measurements. We provide the first set of large-scale evidence for gut microbiome dysbiosis in hyperuricemia, which relates to meat intake. We build a cardiometabolic disease risk model based on gut microbes for initial screening in a young population and confirm the validity using external cohorts. Fecal bacteria that have been reported to be enriched in colorectal cancer (CRC) are found to correlate with methylhistidines, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), aromatic amino acids and glutamic acid in these young individuals, which were validated by an additional cohort of 1404 individuals. Our comprehensive data suggest that the gut microbiome could show trends towards diseases years before onset, and the results lay the foundation for the design of larger screens for cardiometabolic diseases and CRC with clinically meaningful cutoffs.},

A change in microbial diversity, referred as microbial dysbiosis, alters the gut fermentation profile and intestinal wall integrity and causes metabolic endotoxemia, low-grade inflammation, autoimmunity, and other affiliated metabolic disorders.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prospective association of fruit and vegetable intake with human gut microbiota and to examine the relationship between fruit and vegetable-related gut microbiota and their related metabolites with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. This study included 1879 middle-age elderly Chinese adults from Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study (GNHS). Baseline dietary information was collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire (2008–2013). Fecal samples were collected at follow-up (2015–2019) and analyzed for 16S rRNA sequencing and targeted fecal metabolomics. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin. We used multivariable linear regression and logistic regression models to investigate the prospective associations of fruit and vegetable intake with gut microbiota and the association of the identified gut microbiota (fruit/vegetable-microbiota index) and their related fecal metabolites with T2D risk, respectively. Replications were performed in an independent cohort involving 6626 participants. In the GNHS, dietary fruit intake, but not vegetable, was prospectively associated with gut microbiota diversity and composition. The fruit-microbiota index (FMI, created from 31 identified microbial features) was positively associated with fruit intake (p < 0.001) and inversely associated with T2D risk (odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95%CI 0.71–0.97). The FMI-fruit association (p = 0.003) and the FMI-T2D association (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.84–0.97) were both successfully replicated in the independent cohort. The FMI-positive associated metabolite sebacic acid was inversely associated with T2D risk (OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.51–0.86). The FMI-negative associated metabolites cholic acid (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13–1.62), 3-dehydrocholic acid (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.09–1.54), oleylcarnitine (OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.45–2.20), linoleylcarnitine (OR 1.66, 95%CI 1.37–2.05), palmitoylcarnitine (OR 1.62, 95%CI 1.33–2.02), and 2-hydroglutaric acid (OR 1.47, 95%CI 1.25–1.72) were positively associated with T2D risk. Higher fruit intake-associated gut microbiota and metabolic alteration were associated with a lower risk of T2D, supporting the public dietary recommendation of adopting high fruit intake for the T2D prevention.},

The gut bacterial richness and diversity of individuals in the T2D−No−M group were lesser than other groups. Interestingly, we found a significant difference in the beta diversity of the gut microbiota among all groups. Higher abundance was found for Comamonadaceae in PRE, and Sutterella spp. in T2D−No−M. In addition, we found associations of specific microbial taxa with clinical parameters. Finally, we report predicted metabolic pathways of gut microbiota linked to T2D−M and PRE conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that each group has specific predicted metabolic characteristics and gut bacteria populations for each phenotype.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown a clear link between gut microbiota and type 2 diabetes. However, current results are based on cross-sectional studies that aim to determine the microbial dysbiosis when the disease is already prevalent. ABSTRACT The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been increasing globally, and a growing body of evidence links type 2 diabetes with altered microbiota composition. Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long prediabetic state characterized by changes in various metabolic parameters. We tested whether the gut microbiome could have predictive potential for T2D development during the healthy and prediabetic disease stages. We used prospective data of 608 well-phenotyped Finnish men collected from the population-based Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study to build machine learning models for predicting continuous glucose and insulin measures in a shorter (1.5 year) and longer (4 year) period. Our results show that the inclusion of the gut microbiome improves prediction accuracy for modeling T2D-associated parameters such as glycosylated hemoglobin and insulin measures. We identified novel microbial biomarkers and described their effects on the predictions using interpretable machine learning techniques, which revealed complex linear and nonlinear associations. Additionally, the modeling strategy carried out allowed us to compare the stability of model performance and biomarker selection, also revealing differences in short-term and long-term predictions. The identified microbiome biomarkers provide a predictive measure for various metabolic traits related to T2D, thus providing an additional parameter for personal risk assessment. Our work also highlights the need for robust modeling strategies and the value of interpretable machine learning. IMPORTANCE Recent studies have shown a clear link between gut microbiota and type 2 diabetes. However, current results are based on cross-sectional studies that aim to determine the microbial dysbiosis when the disease is already prevalent. In order to consider the microbiome as a factor in disease risk assessment, prospective studies are needed. Our study is the first study that assesses the gut microbiome as a predictive measure for several type 2 diabetes-associated parameters in a longitudinal study setting. Our results revealed a number of novel microbial biomarkers that can improve the prediction accuracy for continuous insulin measures and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. These results make the prospect of using the microbiome in personalized medicine promising.},

abstract = {More than a decade of gut microbiome studies have a common goal of improving human health. However, while most of the disease studies have focused on the elderly or the middle-aged, a reference cohort for the gut microbiome in young individuals has been lacking. It is also not clear what other omics data need to be measured to better understand the gut microbiome. Here, we present a cohort including 2183 adults with high-depth metagenomic shotgun sequencing data for the fecal microbiome and other omics data. In this multiomic cohort, we observe a number of vitamins, hormones, amino acids, and trace elements that correlated with the gut microbiome. Many of the associations are validated in an additional cohort consisting of 1404 individuals. Our comprehensive data are poised to provide advice to future populations and mechanistic study designs to better understand and manage our gut microbiome.},

abstract = {Despite that obesity is associated with many metabolic diseases, a significant proportion (10–30 %) of obese individuals is recognized as ‘metabolically healthy obeses’ (MHOs). The aim of the current study is to characterize the gut microbiome for MHOs as compared to ‘metabolically unhealthy obeses’ (MUOs). We compared the gut microbiome of 172 MHO and 138 MUO individuals from Chongqing (China) (inclined to eat red meat and food with a spicy taste), and performed validation with selected biomarkers in 40 MHOs and 33 MUOs from Quanzhou (China) (inclined to eat seafood and food with a light/bland taste). The genera Alistipes , Faecalibacterium and Odoribacter had increased abundance in both Chongqing and Quanzhou MHOs. We also observed different microbial functions in MUOs compared to MHOs, including an increased abundance of genes associated with glycan biosynthesis and metabolism. In addition, the microbial gene markers identified from the Chongqing cohort bear a moderate accuracy [AUC (area under the operating characteristic curve)=0.69] for classifying MHOs distinct from MUOs in the Quanzhou cohort. These findings indicate that gut microbiome is significantly distinct between MHOs and MUOs, implicating the potential of the gut microbiome in stratification and refined management of obesity.},

abstract = {Abstract The human microbiome is increasingly mined for diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. However, computational tools tailored to such analyses are still scarce. Here, we present the SIAMCAT R package, a versatile and user-friendly toolbox for comparative metagenome analyses using machine learning (ML), statistical tests, and visualization. Based on a large meta-analysis of gut microbiome studies, we optimized the choice of ML algorithms and preprocessing routines for default workflow settings. Furthermore, we illustrate common pitfalls leading to overfitting and show how SIAMCAT safeguards against these to make statistically rigorous ML workflows broadly accessible. SIAMCAT is available from siamcat.embl.de and Bioconductor.},

abstract = {Heliciculture produce snails that are eaten in many regions of Spain, especially in some areas where they are considered a delicacy. The fact of producing large snails would allow to maximize profits and for this reason to find the factors that regulate the weight of these mollusks is economically very interesting. In recent years, microbiota has been linked to weight in several species, including humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible differences in the intestinal microbiota between snails (Helix aspersa) of different weights to establish the relationship between both. To do this, Aerobic Mesophilic, Lactic-Acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae counts were compared in stool samples from two groups of animals, distributed by weight. Furthermore, the evolution of the counts of these bacterial groups was observed from the waking from hibernation until the end of the study, after 22 days. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the two study groups in bacterial counts. In addition, no clear trend was observed in these counts during the course of the experiment. Additional studies could explain the differences found in this study compared with what is found in other papers.},

It has been assumed that an increased caloric intake and a more sedentary lifestyle are the main causes of this rise. However, recent evidence has shown that the microbes that live in the human gastrointestinal tract may play a role in the regulation of weight and obesity development. These microbes, termed the gut microbiota, are commensal and symbiotic microbes that are densely populated throughout an individual’s gastrointestinal tract. This paper presents the relevant research and possible mechanisms of how these microbes, mainly bacteria, are thought to play a role in weight regulation and obesity.},
