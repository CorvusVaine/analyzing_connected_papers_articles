abstract = {Using deep learning approaches, a prediction tool is developed, Preoptem, to screen thermophilic proteins for efficient chitin biodegradation, and provides a method to mine the novel thermophobic chit inase for efficientChitinBiodegradation. Chitin is abundant in nature and its degradation products are highly valuable for numerous applications. Thermophilic chitinases are increasingly appreciated for their capacity to biodegrade chitin at high temperatures and prolonged enzyme stability. Here, using deep learning approaches, we developed a prediction tool, Preoptem, to screen thermophilic proteins. A novel thermophilic chitinase, Chi304, was mined directly from the marine metagenome. Chi304 showed maximum activity at 85 ℃, its T m reached 89.65 ± 0.22℃, and exhibited excellent thermal stability at 80 and 90 °C. Chi304 had both endo- and exo-chitinase activities, and the (GlcNAc) 2 was the main hydrolysis product of chitin-related substrates. The product yields of colloidal chitin degradation reached 97% within 80 min, and 20% over 4 days of reaction with crude chitin powder. This study thus provides a method to mine the novel thermophilic chitinase for efficient chitin biodegradation. Graphical Abstract},

abstract = {Cellulose, hemicellulose and chitin are the three most abundant polysaccharides on the earth. Cellulose and Due to the increase in the energy demand chitinases have become relatively important in the past few decades. Chitinases, produced by bacteria, fungi, insects, and plants, have been used in several applications ranging from anti-phytopathogen to antitumor cancer agents. Evolution in molecular biology and genetic engineering has given new prospects in understanding the structure functionality and catalytic mechanisms. of chitinases at molecular level. Owing to their applicability in different fields, studies related to chitinases have become very important. Synergism between the cellulases and chitinases has supported in understanding the catalytic mechanism and developing a deep understanding of the both types of the enzymes. Literature suggest that there are few reports on extremophilic chitinases production. Molecular biology and genetic engineering have only helped in the expression and understanding of extremophilic chitinases so far. This chapter focuses on the various sources of chitinases, their production and catalytic mechanisms, extremophilic chitinases molecular studies and their potential applications. This chapter also provides an insight on the various aspects of chitinases with emphasis on both research and industry.},

Chi6769 was purified by HisTrap HP affinity chromatography with optimal pH of 7.0. The enzymatic hydrolysis assay revealed that Chi6769 was capable of hydrolyzing chitin to (GlcNAc)3, (GlcNAc)2 and GlcNAc. (GlcNAc)2 was the main hydrolyzate. The antifungal activity result showed that Chi6769 exhibited strong antifungal activity toward Valsa mali 03-8.

abstract = {This paper reports the isolation and identification of an acido-thermostable chitinase (ChiA-Ba43) which was purified, from the culture liquid of Bacillus altitudinis strain KA15, and characterized. Purification of ChiA-Ba43 produced a 69.6-fold increase in the specific activity (120,000 U/mg) of the chitinase, with a yield of 51% using colloidal chitin as substrate. ChiA-Ba43 was found to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 43,190.05 Da as determined by MALDI-TOF/MS. N-terminal sequence of the first 27 amino-acids (aa) of ChiA-Ba43 displayed homology to chitinases from other Bacillus species. Interestingly, ChiA-Ba43 exhibited optimum pH and temperature of 4-5.5 and 85 °C, respectively. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) showed that the final hydrolyzed products of the enzyme from chitin-oligosaccharides and colloidal chitin are a mixture of (GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)3, (GlcNAc)4, and (GlcNAc)5, which indicates that ChiA-Ba43 possesses an endo-acting function. More interestingly, compared to ChiA-Mt45, ChiA-Hh59, Chitodextrinase®, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase®, and ChiA-65, ChiA-Ba43 demonstrated a high level of catalytic efficiency and outstanding tolerance towards various organic solvents. The chiA-Ba43 gene (1332 bp) encoding ChiA-Ba43 (409 aa) was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli strain HB101. The biochemical properties of the recombinant chitinase (rChiA-Ba43) were equivalent to those of the natively expressed enzyme. These properties make ChiA-Ba43 an ideal candidate for industrial bioconversion of chitinous waste.},

Pure enzyme was obtained after ammonium sulphate precipitation (30-60%), followed by sequential column chromatographies on Sephacryl S-200 HR and Mono Q-Sepharose.

Moreover, ChiA-Ba43 acted as an endo-splitting enzyme as showed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) from enzymatic catalyzed hydrolysis of chitin-oligosaccharides and colloidal chitin. More interstingly, ChiA-Ba43 showed a high level of catalytic efficiency compared to chitinases ChiA-Mt45, ChiA-Hh59, Chitodextrinase®, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase®, and ChiA-65.

Here we report detailed insights into the chitin degradation by chitinase-E from a chitinolytic bacterium Chitiniphilus shinanonensis (CsChiE). CsChiE was optimally active at 50 °C in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH-7.0. It showed a kcat and overall catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) as 3.9 × 103 s-1 and 0.6 × 103 s-1 mg-1 mL, respectively, on colloidal chitin (CC). CsChiE efficiently hydrolyzed crystalline polymers like α-, β- and CC and released chitobiose as the predominant product (11.3 mM on CC). Further, CsChiE displayed substantial activity towards the unmilled crab shell chitin waste (chitin-flakes) and generated chitobiose. Activity studies on chitooligosaccharides revealed that CsChiE produced chitobiose as the major product. Our results indicate that the multi-modular CsChiE is a non-processive exo-chitinase which is more suitable to generate chitobiose from a variety of chitinous substrates including unprocessed chitin-flakes.},

Purified chitinase is a homogenous monomer with molecular mass of 40 kDa. Its N-terminal residues revealed significant identity with glycoside hydrolase family 18 (GH18) chitinases from Gammaproteobacteria. Using colloidal chitin as a substrate, its finest activity was accomplished at pH 4 and a temperature of 70 °C. Its catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was superior to that of some bacterial GH18 chitinases and commercial enzyme, Chitodextrinase®. For scale-up and with regards to the improvement of ChiA-Si40 with PEG-6000 storage stability (6 months), the atomizing process was more pronounced than that of lyophilizing. Bio-assay of ChiA-Si40 against grain weevil Sitophilus granarius, indicates that it had an efficient insecticidal effect. About 10 to 100% mortality rates were obtained 1-h after insect came in contact with ChiA-Si40. Histological study clearly demonstrated that luxury larval mid-gut, peritrophic-membrane, and epithelial-cells have been affected considerably after ChiA-Si40 treatment. These properties make ChiA-Si40 a potential bio-insecticidal agent for the biological control of S. granarius that is popular among insect pests of stored grains in Algeria.},

abstract = {Background Chitinases are enzymes which degrade β-1,4-glycosidid linkages in chitin. The enzymatic degradation of shellfish waste (containing chitin) to chitooligosaccharides is used in industrial applications to generate high-value-added products from such waste. However, chitinases are currently produced with low efficiency and poor tolerance, limiting the industrial utility. Therefore, identifying chitinases with higher enzymatic activity and tolerance is of great importance. Methods Primers were designed using the genomic database of Paenibacillus chitinolyticus NBRC 15660. An exochitinase (CHI) was cloned into the recombinant plasmid pET-22b (+) to form pET-22b (+)-CHI, which was transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 to construct a genomic library. Transformation was confirmed by colony-polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis. The target sequence was verified by sequencing. Recombinant pET-22b (+)-CHI was transformed into E. coli Rosetta-gami B (DE3) for expression of chitinase. Recombinant protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and enzymatic analysis was carried out. Results The exochitinase CHI from P. chitinolyticus strain UMBR 0002 was successfully cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli Rosetta-gami B (DE3). Purification yielded a 13.36-fold enrichment and recovery yield of 72.20%. The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 750.64 mU mg−1. The optimum pH and temperature for degradation of colloidal chitin were 5.0 and 45 °C, respectively. The enzyme showed high stability, retaining >70% activity at pH 4.0–10.0 and 25–45 °C (maximum of 90 min). The activity of CHI strongly increased with the addition of Ca2+, Mn2+, Tween 80 and urea. Conversely, Cu2+, Fe3+, acetic acid, isoamyl alcohol, sodium dodecyl sulfate and β-mercaptoethanol significantly inhibited enzyme activity. The oligosaccharides produced by CHI from colloidal chitin exhibited a degree of polymerization, forming N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and (GlcNAc)2 as products. Conclusions This is the first report of the cloning, heterologous expression and purification of a chitinase from P. chitinolyticus strain UMBR 0002. The results highlight CHI as a good candidate enzyme for green degradation of chitinous waste.},

abstract = {BackgroundN-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) possesses many bioactivities that have been used widely in many fields. The enzymatic production of GlcNAc is eco-friendly, with high yields and a mild production process compared with the traditional chemical process. Therefore, it is crucial to discover a better chitinase for GlcNAc production from chitin.ResultsA novel chitinase gene (Cmchi1) cloned from Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis SYBC-H1 and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The recombinant enzyme (CmChi1) contains a glycosyl hydrolase family 18 catalytic module that shows low identity (12–27%) with the corresponding domain of the well-characterized chitinases. CmChi1 was purified with a recovery yield of 89% by colloidal chitin affinity chromatography, whereupon it had a specific activity of up to 15.3 U/mg. CmChi1 had an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa after the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its optimum activity for colloidal chitin (CC) hydrolysis occurred at pH 5.2 and 50 °C. Furthermore, CmChi1 exhibited kcat/Km values of 7.8 ± 0.11 mL/s/mg and 239.1 ± 2.6 mL/s/μmol toward CC and 4-nitrophenol N,N′-diacetyl-β-d-chitobioside [p-NP-(GlcNAc)2], respectively. Analysis of the hydrolysis products revealed that CmChi1 exhibits exo-acting, endo-acting and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activities toward N-acetyl chitooligosaccharides (N-acetyl CHOS) and CC substrates, behavior that makes it different from typical reported chitinases. As a result, GlcNAc could be produced by hydrolyzing CC using recombinant CmChi1 alone with a yield of nearly 100% and separated simply from the hydrolysate with a high purity of 98%.ConclusionThe hydrolytic properties and good environmental adaptions indicate that CmChi1 has excellent potential in commercial GlcNAc production.

abstract = {A strain producing chitinase, isolated from potato stem tissue, was identified as Bacillus licheniformis by biochemical properties and 16S RNA sequence analysis. Statistical experimental designs were used to optimize nine independent variables for chitinase production by B. licheniformis AT6 strain in submerged fermentation. Using Plackett–Burman design, (NH4)2SO4, MgSO4.7H2O, colloidal chitin, MnCl2 2H2O, and temperature were found to influence chitinase production significantly. According to Box–Behnken response surface methodology, the optimal fermentation conditions allowing maximum chitinase production were (in gram per liter): (NH4)2SO4, 7; K2HPO4, 1; NaCl, 1; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1; yeast extract, 0.5; colloidal chitin, 7.5; MnCl2.2H2O, 0.2; temperature 35 °C; pH medium 7. The optimization strategy led to a 10-fold increase in chitinase activity (505.26 ± 22.223 mU/mL versus 50.35 ± 19.62 mU/mL for control basal medium). A major protein band with a molecular weight of 61.9 kDa corresponding to chitinase activity was clearly detected under optimized conditions. Chitinase activity produced in optimized medium mainly releases N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) monomer from colloidal chitin. This enzyme also acts as an exochitinase with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. These results suggest that B. licheniformis AT6 secreting exochitinase is highly efficient in GlcNAc production which could in turn be envisaged as a therapeutic agent or as a conservator against the alteration of several ailments.},

Chitinase was purified in three steps involving ammonium sulphate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography and Sephacryl S-300 gel chromatography. 12.55 fold increase in purity with a recovery of 17.6 was obtained. The molecular mass of the purified chitinase was found to be 130kDa. It was optimally active at pH 4.5 and 40°C. Km and Vmax values were 0.22mgmL-1 and 19.6μmolemin-1mg-1 respectively. Mn2+ and Zn2+ ions lead to increased chitinase activity. While Fe2+and Cu2+ions strongly inhibited the chitinase activity. The thermodynamics of pure chitinase including activation energy for thermal denaturation (Ea,d), change of free energy (ΔGd), enthalpy(ΔHd), entropy(ΔSd) and half life values (T1/2) at 40, 50 and 60°C were determined. Chitinase showed antifungal activity against pathogenic fungus Fusarium solani. Chitosanase was partially purified by acetone precipitation (50-75%) v/v concentration. The hydrolytic products of moderate molecular weight of chitosan by chitosanase were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) after 12 and 24h respectively. Chitosan-oligosaccharides showed good antibacterial and antioxidant activities.},

abstract = {Paenibacillus thermoaerophilus strain TC22-2b, a thermophilic bacterium with an optimum growth temperature of 50–55 °C isolated from compost (55 °C) in Japan, secreted a chitinase into culture medium in the presence of colloidal chitin. Adding glucose, lactose, mannose, or sucrose to culture medium decreased the amount of chitinase in culture supernatants. This chitinase was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, colloidal chitin adsorption, and ion exchange chromatography. The apparent molecular mass of this enzyme was approximately 48 kDa, and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be Ala–Val–Ser–Thr–Gly–Lys–Lys. The optimum temperature and pH for chitinase activity were 60 °C and pH 4, respectively. The chitinase retained 68 % of its initial activity after incubation at 50 °C for 2 h. Using p-nitrophenyl N,N′-diacetyl-β-d-chitobioside [pNP-(GlcNAc)2] as a substrate, the Km, Vmax, and kcat values for this enzyme were 1.4 mM, 0.058 mM min−1, and 9.6 s−1, respectively. Analysis of hydrolysis products showed that the chitinase digested N-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides in an endo manner. N-acetylglucosamine dimers were not degraded by the enzyme. When colloidal chitin was used as the substrate, N-acetylglucosamine dimers, -trimers, and -tetramers were detected as hydrolysis products. Thus, the thermophilic chitinase may prove useful for industrial applications in chitooligosaccharide production from chitin biomass.},

abstract = {BackgroundN-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) is widely used as a valuable pharmacological agent and a functional food additive. The traditional chemical process for GlcNAc production has some problems such as high production cost, low yield, and acidic pollution. Hence, to identify a novel chitinase that is suitable for bioconversion of chitin to GlcNAc is of great value.ResultsA novel chitinase gene (PbChi74) from Paenibacillus barengoltzii was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as an intracellular soluble protein. The gene has an open reading frame (ORF) of 2,163 bp encoding 720 amino acids. The recombinant chitinase (PbChi74) was purified to apparent homogeneity with a purification fold of 2.2 and a recovery yield of 57.9%. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 74.6 kDa and 74.3 kDa by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. PbChi74 displayed an acidic pH optimum of 4.5 and a temperature optimum of 65°C. The enzyme showed high activity toward colloidal chitin, glycol chitin, N-acetyl chitooligosaccharides, and p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl β-glucosaminide. PbChi74 hydrolyzed colloidal chitin to yield N- acetyl chitobiose [(GlcNAc)2] at the initial stage, which was further converted to its monomer N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), suggesting that it is an exochitinase with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. The purified PbChi74 coupled with RmNAG (β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Rhizomucor miehei) was used to convert colloidal chitin to GlcNAc, and GlcNAc was the sole end product at a concentration of 27.8 mg mL-1 with a conversion yield of 92.6%. These results suggest that PbChi74 may have great potential in chitin conversion.ConclusionsThe excellent thermostability and hydrolytic properties may give the exochitinase great potential in GlcNAc production from chitin.

abstract = {BackgroundThe ability to use organic solvents in enzyme reactions offers a number of industrially useful advantages. However, most enzymes are almost completely inactive in the presence of organic solvents. Thus, organic solvent-tolerant enzymes have potential applications in industrial processes.ResultsA chitinase gene from Microbulbifer thermotolerans DAU221 (mtch509) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The molecular weight of the expressed MtCh509 protein was approximately 60 kDa, and it was purified by His-tag affinity chromatography. Enzymatic assays showed that the optimum temperature for MtCh509 chitinase activity was 55 °C, and the enzyme was stable for 2 h at up to 50 °C. The optimum pH for MtCh509 activity was in the sub-acidic range, at pH 4.6 and 5.0. The activity of MtCh509 was maintained in presence of 1 M salt, gradually decreasing at higher concentrations, with residual activity (20%) detected after incubation in 5 M salt. Some organic solvents (benzene, DMSO, hexane, isoamyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and toluene; 10–20%, v/v) increased the reactivity of MtCh509 relative to the aqueous system. When using NAG3, as a substrate, MtCh509 produced NAG2 as the major product, as well as NAG4, demonstrating that MtCh509 has transglycosylation activity. The Km and Vmax values for MtCh509 using colloidal chitin as a substrate were 9.275 mg/mL and 20.4 U/mg, respectively. Thus, MtCh509 could be used in extreme industrial conditions.ConclusionThe results of the hydrolysate analysis and the observed increase in enzyme activity in the presence of organic solvents show that MtCh509 has industrially attractive advantages.

abstract = {The chitinase B gene (chiB65) ofBacillus licheniformis A1 (BlicA1) isolated from Diyadin hotspring in Turkey was cloned and sequenced. The gene is 1779 bp long and encodes a protein 592 amino acids with a 35-amino acid signal peptide at N-terminal. The gene has 99% percent similarity tochiB gene ofBacillus licheniformis under the GenBank number AY205293. The gene without signal peptide was overexpressed inEscherichia coli and the recombinant protein purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The activity of enzyme was shown on SDS-PAGE with the flourogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-N,N′-diacetylchitobioside. Kinetic characterisation of the enzyme was performed at 65 °C by using chromogenic substratep-nitrophenylN,N′-diacetyl-β-D-chitobioside, andKm and Vmax were found to be 0.02 μM and 1017 U/mg protein, respectively. Enzyme has maximal activity at pH 6.0 and was stable over a broad pH range of 5.0–9.0 for 24 h at room temperature and 4 h at 65 °C. Enzyme was 60% stable at 65 °C for 1.5 h. The inhibition or activation of some substances on the activity of enzyme was determined. High kinetic properties of enzyme open the possibility of an extensive structural and enzyme-substrate interaction studies.},

The nucleotide sequencing revealed a single open reading frame containing 1781 bp and encoding 597 amino acids with 66 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymogram. The chitinase was composed of three domains: a catalytic domain, a fibronectin III domain, and a chitin binding domain. The chitinase was purified by GST-fusion purification system. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 7.5 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The metal ions, Zn(2+), Cu(2+), and Hg(2+), were strongly inhibited chitinase activity. However, chitinase activity was increased 1.4-fold by Co(2+). Chisb could hydrolyze GlcNAc(2) to N-acetylglucosamine and was produced GlcNAc(2), when chitin derivatives were used as the substrate. This indicated that Chisb was a bifunctional enzyme, N-acetylglucosaminase and chitobiosidase. The enzyme could not hydrolyze glycol chitin, glycol chitosan, or CMC, but hydrolyzed colloidal chitin and soluble chitosan.},

Enhancement in chitinase production (Qp = 2.9662 Ul-1 h-1) was achieved through derivation of optimum fermentation conditions via central composite design. H. grisea observed to produce various isoforms of chitinase, among which the major expressed form has molecular mass of about 50 kDa. Purified chitinases exhibited optimal activity at pH 3.0 and 70 °C. Chitinase showed notable stability at increasing temperatures. Half-life of chitinase is 169.06 min at optimum temperature. Chitinase has effectively catalyzed N-acetyl chitobiose (GlcNAc)2, and N-acetyl chitotriose (GlcNAc)3 and colloidal chitin. Purified chitinase from H. grisea showed high affinity towards colloidal chitin as evident by its comparatively lower Km value. Presence of metal ions viz. Mn2+, Co2+, NH4+ and Mg2+ significantly increased the chitinase activity. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis revealed the significant hydrolyzing competence of HgChi for colloidal chitin, (GlcNAc)3 and (GlcNAc)2 into oligomers and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Thermostable chitinase appeared as potential candidate for efficient conversion of chitin to bioactive oligosaccharides at industrial scale.},

However, low chitinase activity and yield of chitooligosaccharides limit the production and application. Herein, we used a series of molecular biology strategies to increase the expression of chitinase in Bacillus subtilis WB600. Upon addition of the signal peptide NprB, Chisb was successfully secreted to the outside of the cell and extracellular expression level reached 35.54 U/mL. Furthermore, optimizing Ribosome Binding Sites (RBSs) with spacer sequences, and combining molecular docking technology with site-directed mutagenesis, the expression level and the specific activity of Chisb was further increased to 51.67 U/mL and 249.62 U/mg, respectively. When colloidal chitin was used as the substrate, the chitooligosaccharides detected by ion chromatography were (GlcNAc)1-5, and the total yield of chitooligosaccharides was 14.4%. Our results indicate that strategies for increasing Chisb expression contribute to the study and application of chitinase and the production of chitooligosaccharides.},

abstract = {The biocontrol activity of some soil strains of Chromobacterium sp. against pathogenic fungi has been attributed to secreted chitinases. The aim of this work was to characterize biochemically a recombinant chitinase (CvChi47) from C. violaceum ATCC 12472 and to investigate its effects on phytopathogenic fungi. CvChi47 is a modular enzyme with 450 amino acid residues, containing a type I signal peptide at the N-terminal region, followed by one catalytic domain belonging to family 18 of the glycoside hydrolases, and two type-3 chitin-binding domains at the C-terminal end. The recombinant enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged protein and purified to homogeneity. The native signal peptide of CvChi47 was used to direct its secretion into the culture medium, from where the recombinant product was purified by affinity chromatography on chitin and immobilized metal. The purified protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, as estimated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating the removal of the signal peptide. CvChi47 was a thermostable protein, retaining approximately 53.7% of its activity when heated at 100 °C for 1 h. The optimum hydrolytic activity was observed at 60 °C and pH 5. The recombinant chitinase inhibited the conidia germination of the phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum and F. guttiforme, hence preventing mycelial growth. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy experiments revealed a pronounced morphological alteration of the cell surface of conidia incubated with CvChi47 in comparison to untreated cells. Taken together, these results show the potential of CvChi47 as a molecular tool to control plant diseases caused by these Fusarium species.},

The degradation of chitin using chitinases is one way to address the accumulation of chitin waste streams in the environment, and research has therefore focused on the identification, improvement and expression of suitable enzymes. Here we describe the production, purification and characterization of Bacillus licheniformis chitinase A in the Pichia pastoris expression system. Optimal enzyme activity occurred at pH 4.0-5.0 and within the temperature range 50-60 °C. With colloidal chitin as the substrate, the Km (2.307 mM) and Vmax (0.024 mM min-1) of the enzyme were determined using a 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid assay. The degradation products of colloidal chitin and hexa-N-acetylchitohexaose were compared by thin-layer chromatography. The activity of the glycosylated enzyme produced in P. pastoris was compared with the in vitro deglycosylated and aglycosylated version produced in Escherichia coli. We showed that the glycosylated chitinase was more active than the deglycosylated and aglycosylated variants.},

abstract = {The optimal conditions required for chitinase production from Bacillus licheniformis B307 strain, obtained from Syrian soil, were studied. Optimization experiments were carried out under submerged fermentation conditions, and colloidal chitin was the source of carbon. Luria broth medium supplied with 0.5% colloidal chitin was the optimum medium for chitinase production. The maximum chitinase yield was obtained at 30 °C, pH6, incubation time 14 days, and 150 rpm. The optimum chitinase activity was achieved at 60 °C and pH6. The chitinase activity with unmodified medium was 1.9 U/mL which then enhanced about eight folds to reach 14.2 U/mL under optimized submerged fermentation conditions. An extracellular chitinase of Bacillus licheniformis B307 was partially purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by concentration with various sizes of concentrator tubes. The chitinase was partially purified 8.24 fold and specific enzyme activity increased 2.08 fold (2 U/mg). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of partial purified chitinase exhibited a molecular weight (Mr) near to 36 and 42kDa. These results make it possible to invest in this strain to produce chitinase to be used as antifungal, food additives and other applications.},

abstract = {This present study is the first attempt to report on the purification and characterization of a chitinase from the stomach of the red scorpionfish Scorpaena scrofa. A 50-kDa chitinase (SsChi50) was purified to homogeneity, and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis showed that SsChi50 was a monomer with a molecular mass of 50,103 Da. The 25 N-terminal residues of SsChi50 displayed high homology with family-18 chitinases. Optimal activity was obtained at pH 5.0 at 80 °C. SsChi50 was stable at pH and temperature ranges of 3.0 to 7.0 and 70 to 90 °C for 48 and 4 h respectively. Among the inhibitors and metals tested, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, Hg2+, and Hg+ completely inhibited enzyme activity. Chitinase activity was high on colloidal chitin, glycol chitin, glycol chitosane, chitotriose, and chitooligosaccharide. Chitinase activity towards synthetic substrates in the order of p-NP-(GlcNAc)n (n=2 –4) was p-NP-(GlcNAc)2 > p-NP-(GlcNAc)4 > p-NP-(GlcNAc)3. Our results suggest that the SsChi50 enzyme preferentially hydrolyzed the second glycosidic link from the non-reducing end of (GlcNAc)n. This enzyme obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the K m and k cat values being 0.412 mg, colloidal chitin mL−1 and 5.33 s−1 respectively. An in vivo bioinsecticidal assay was developed for SsChi50 against Callosobruchus maculatus adults. The enzyme showed bioinsecticidal activity toward Callosobruchus maculatus, indicating the possibility of using it in biotechnological strategies for insect management for stored cowpea seeds.},
