abstract = {From the perspective of forensics genetics, the human microbiome is a rich, relatively untapped resource for human identity testing. Since it varies within and among people, and perhaps temporally, the potential forensic applications of the use of the microbiome can exceed that of human identification. However, the same inherent variability in microbial distributions may pose a substantial barrier to forming predictions on an individual as the source of the microbial sample unless stable signatures of the microbiome are identified and targeted. One of the more commonly adopted strategies for microbial human identification relies on quantifying which taxa are present and their respective abundance levels. It remains an open question if such microbial signatures are more individualizing than estimates of the degree of genetic relatedness between microbial samples. This study attempts to address this question by contrasting two prediction strategies. The first approach uses phylogenetic distance to predict the host individual; thus it operates under the premise that microbes within individuals are more closely related than microbes between/among individuals. The second approach uses population genetic measures of diversity at clade-specific markers, serving as a fine-grained assessment of microbial composition and quantification. Both assessments were performed using targeted sequencing of 286 markers from 22 microbial taxa sampled in 51 individuals across three body sites measured in triplicate. Nearest neighbor and reverse nearest neighbor classifiers were constructed based on the pooled data and yielded 71% and 78% accuracy, respectively, when diversity was considered, and performed significantly worse when a phylogenetic distance was used (54% and 63% accuracy, respectively). However, empirical estimates of classification accuracy were 100% when conditioned on a maximum nearest neighbor distance when diversity was used, while identification based on a phylogenetic distance failed to reach saturation. These findings suggest that microbial strain composition is more individualizing than that of a phylogeny, perhaps indicating that microbial composition may be more individualizing than recent common ancestry. One inference that may be drawn from these findings is that host-environment interactions may maintain the targeted microbial profile and that this maintenance may not necessarily be repopulated by intra-individual microbial strains.},

abstract = {In recent years many studies have highlighted the great potential of microbial analysis in human identification for forensic purposes, with important differences in microbial community composition and function across different people and locations, showing a certain degree of uncertainty. Therefore, further studies are necessary to enable forensic scientists to evaluate the risk of microbial transfer and recovery from various items and to further critically evaluate the suitability of current human DNA recovery protocols for human microbial profiling for identification purposes. While the establishment and development of microbiome research biobanks for clinical applications is already very structured, the development of studies on the applicability of microbiome biobanks for forensic purposes is still in its infancy. The creation of large population microbiome biobanks, specifically dedicated to forensic human identification, could be worthwhile. This could also be useful to increase the practical applications of forensic microbiology for identification purposes, given that this type of evidence is currently absent from most real casework investigations and judicial proceedings in courts.},

abstract = {Human blood traces are amongst the most commonly encountered biological stains collected at crime scenes. Identifying the body site of origin of a forensic blood trace can provide crucial information in many cases, such as in sexual and violent assaults. However, means for reliably and accurately identifying from which body site a forensic blood trace originated are missing, but would be highly valuable in crime scene investigations. With this study, we introduce a taxonomy-independent deep neural network approach based on massively parallel microbiome sequencing, which delivers accurate body site of origin classification of forensically-relevant blood samples, such as menstrual, nasal, fingerprick, and venous blood. A total of 50 deep neural networks were trained using a large 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset from 773 reference samples, including 220 female urogenital tract, 190 nasal cavity, 213 skin, and 150 venous blood samples. Validation was performed with de-novo generated 16S rRNA gene massively parallel sequencing (MPS) data from 94 blood test samples of four different body sites, and achieved high classification accuracy with AUC values at 0.992 for menstrual blood (N = 23), 0.978 for nasal blood (N = 16), 0.978 for fingerprick blood (N = 30), and 0.990 for venous blood (N = 25). The obtained highly accurate classification of menstrual blood was independent of the day of the menses, as established in additional 86 menstrual blood test samples. Accurate body site of origin classification was also revealed for 45 fresh and aged mock casework blood samples from all four body sites. Our novel microbiome approach works based on the assumption that a sample is from blood, as can be obtained in forensic practise from prior presumptive blood testing, and provides accurate information on the specific body source of blood, with high potentials for future forensic applications.},

abstract = {Current body fluid identification methods do not reveal any information about the time since deposition (TsD) of biological traces, even though determining the age of traces could be crucial for the investigative process. To determine the utility of microbial RNA markers for TsD estimation, we examined RNA sequencing data from five forensically relevant body fluids (blood, menstrual blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretion) over seven time points, ranging from fresh to 1.5 years. One set of samples was stored indoors while another was exposed to outdoor conditions. In outdoor samples, we observed a consistent compositional shift, occurring after 4 weeks: this shift was characterized by an overall increase in non-human eukaryotic RNA and an overall decrease in prokaryotic RNA. In depth analyses showed a high fraction of tree, grass and fungal signatures, which are characteristic for the environment the samples were exposed to. When examining the prokaryotic fraction in more detail, three bacterial phyla were found to exhibit the largest changes in abundance, namely Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. More detailed analyses at the order level were done using a Lasso regression analysis to find a predictive subset of bacterial taxa. We found 26 bacterial orders to be indicative of sample age. Indoor samples did not reveal such a clear compositional change at the domain level: eukaryotic and prokaryotic abundance remained relatively stable across the assessed time period. Nonetheless, a Lasso regression analysis identified 32 bacterial orders exhibiting clear changes over time, enabling the prediction of TsD. For both indoor and outdoor samples, a larger number (around 60%) of the bacterial orders identified as indicative of TsD are part of the Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. In summary, we found that the observed changes across time are not primarily due to changes associated with body fluid specific bacteria but mostly due to accumulation of bacteria from the environment. Orders of these environmental bacteria could be evaluated for TsD prediction, considering the location and environment of the crime scene. However, further studies are needed to verify these findings, determine the applicability across samples, replicates, donors, and other variables, and also to further assess the effect of different seasons and locations on the samples.},

abstract = {Microbial communities have potential evidential utility for forensic applications. However, bioinformatic analysis of high‐throughput sequencing data varies widely among laboratories. These differences can potentially affect microbial community composition and downstream analyses. To illustrate the importance of standardizing methodology, we compared analyses of postmortem microbiome samples using several bioinformatic pipelines, varying minimum library size or minimum number of sequences per sample, and sample size. Using the same input sequence data, we found that three open‐source bioinformatic pipelines, MG‐RAST, mothur, and QIIME2, had significant differences in relative abundance, alpha‐diversity, and beta‐diversity, despite the same input data. Increasing minimum library size and sample size increased the number of low‐abundant and infrequent taxa detected. Our results show that bioinformatic pipeline and parameter choice affect results in important ways. Given the growing potential application of forensic microbiology to the criminal justice system, continued research on standardizing computational methodology will be important for downstream applications.},

This narrative review provides an overview of some of the main scientific works so far produced, focusing on the potentiality of using skin microbiome profiling for human identification in forensics. This review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The examined literature clearly ascertains that skin microbial communities, although personalized, vary systematically across body sites and time, with intrapersonal differences over time smaller than interpersonal ones, showing such a high degree of spatial and temporal variability that the degree and nature of this variability can constitute in itself an important parameter useful in distinguishing individuals from one another. Even making the effort to organically synthesize all results achieved until now, it is quite evident that these results are still the pieces of a puzzle, which is not yet complete.},

Specific microbial species or communities obtained from the crime scene provide evidence of human contacts and their body fluids. The microbial community is influenced by geographic, ethnic, lifestyle, and environmental factors such as urbanization. An understanding of the effects of these external stressors on the human microbiome and determination of stable and changing elements are important in selecting appropriate targets for investigation. In this study, the Forensic Microbiome Database (FMD) (http://www.fmd.jcvi.org) containing the microbiome data of various locations in the human body in 35 countries was used. We focused on skin, saliva, vaginal fluid, and stool and found that the microbiome distribution differed according to the body part as well as the geographic location. In the case of skin samples, Staphylococcus species were higher than Corynebacterium species among Asians compared with Americans. Holdemanella and Fusobacterium were specific in the saliva of Koreans and Japanese populations. Lactobacillus was found in the vaginal fluids of individuals in all countries, whereas Serratia and Enterobacter were endemic to Bolivia and Congo, respectively. This study is the first attempt to collate and describe the observed variation in microbiomes from the forensic microbiome database. As additional microbiome databases are reported by studies worldwide, the diversity of the applications may exceed and expand beyond the initial identification of the host.},

However, the fragmented state of the publicly available data has retarded the development of analysis techniques and, therefore, the implementation of microbiomes as a forensic tool. To address this, we introduce the forensic microbiome database (FMD), which is a collection of 16S rRNA data and associated metadata generated from publicly available data. The raw data was further normalized and processed using a pipeline to create a standardized data set for downstream analysis. We present a website allowing for the exploration of geolocation signals in the FMD. The website allows users to investigate the taxonomic differences between microbiomes harvested from different locations and to predict the geolocation of their data based on the FMD sequences. All the results are presented in dynamic graphics to allow for a rapid and intuitive investigation of the taxonomic distributions underpinning the geolocation signals and prediction between locations. Apart from the forensic aspect, the database also allows exploration and comparison of microbiome samples from different geolocation and between different body sites. The goal of the FMD is to provide the scientific and non-scientific communities with data and tools to explore the possibilities of microbiomes to answer forensic questions and serve as a model for any future such databases.1},

We use ML for forensic source body site identification using shotgun metagenomic sequenced data to verify the presence of microbiomic signatures capable of discriminating between source body sites and then show that accurate prediction is possible. The consistency between cluster membership and actual source body site (purity) exceeded 99% at the genus taxonomy using off-the-shelf ML clustering algorithms. Similar results were obtained at the family level. Accurate predictions were observed for genus, family, and order taxonomies, as well as with a core set of 51 genera. The accurate outcomes from our replicable process should encourage forensic scientists to seriously consider integrating ML predictors into their source body site identification protocols.},

abstract = {The rise of microbiomics and metagenomics has been driven by advances in genomic sequencing technology, improved microbial sampling methods, and fast-evolving approaches in bioinformatics. Humans are a host to diverse microbial communities in and on their bodies, which continuously interact with and alter the surrounding environments. Since information relating to these interactions can be extracted by analyzing human and environmental microbial profiles, they have the potential to be relevant to forensics. In this review, we analyzed over 100 papers describing forensic microbiome applications with emphasis on geolocation, personal identification, trace evidence, manner and cause of death, and inference of the postmortem interval (PMI). We found that although the field is in its infancy, utilizing microbiome and metagenome signatures has the potential to enhance the forensic toolkit. However, many of the studies suffer from limited sample sizes and model accuracies, and unrealistic environmental settings, leaving the full potential of microbiomics to forensics unexplored. It is unlikely that the information that can currently be elucidated from microbiomics can be used by law enforcement. Nonetheless, the research to overcome these challenges is ongoing, and it is foreseeable that microbiome-based evidence could contribute to forensic investigations in the future.},

The skin microbiome is believed to be extremely diverse between individuals, allowing for potential matching between the bacterial communities and touched objects, known as “bacterial profiling”.

Forty-five participants were asked to touch DNA-free playing cards with their dominant and non-dominant hands. Cards were swabbed and bacterial communities determined through 16S rRNA sequencing. Diversity and abundance of bacteria were compared to donor characteristics of gender, age, ethnicity, handedness, home location, sample location, occupation, diet type, use of moisturisers, use of hand sanitisers and use of public transport. Correlations between the bacterial profile with gender, ethnicity, diet type and hand sanitiser use were found. Specifically, the absence of Lactococcus indicated a primarily Chinese diet, while the absence of Alloiococcus indicated female gender, Asian ethnicity and hand sanitiser use. Testing of the prediction models demonstrated highest accuracy for gender estimation, while the prediction of other characteristics showed lower success. This study showed a correlation between the presence of certain bacterial species on donor’s hands and personal characteristics of potential forensic relevance, thus demonstrating a novel application of microbiome genotyping in forensic science.},

Eleven volunteers were enrolled in the study.

STR profiles were successfully typed for 5 out of 22 "touch DNA" samples, while a microbiome profile was obtained for 20 out of 22 "touch microbiome" samples. Six skin core microbiome taxa were identified, as well as unique donor characterizing taxa.

Next generation sequencing technologies increased available genetic data that could be used as evidence by orders of magnitude, and as such, significant additional genetic information is now available for use in forensic science. This includes DNA from the bacteria that live in and on humans, known as the human microbiome. Next generation sequencing of the human microbiome demonstrates that its bacterial DNA can be used to uniquely identify an individual, provide information about their life and behavioral patterns, determine the body site where a sample came from, and estimate postmortem intervals. Bacterial samples from the environment and objects can also be leveraged to address similar questions about the individual(s) who interacted with them. However, the applications of this new field in forensic sciences raises concerns on current methods used in sample processing, including sample collection, storage, and the statistical power of published studies.

Postmortem skin microbiomes were stable during repeated sampling up to 60 h postmortem and were similar to microbiomes of an antemortem population. Objects could be traced to decedents approximately 75% of the time, with smoking pipes and medical devices being especially accurate (100% match), house and car keys being poor (0%), and other objects like phones intermediate (~80%).

The inevitable end point for all living hosts, death, has its own altered microbiome configurations. However, little is understood about the ecology and changes of microbial communities after death, or their potential utility for understanding the health condition of the recently living. Here we reveal distinct postmortem microbiomes of human hosts from a large-scale survey of death cases representing a predominantly urban population, and demonstrated these microbiomes reflected antemortem health conditions within 24–48 hours of death. Our results characterized microbial community structure and predicted function from 188 cases representing a cross-section of an industrial-urban population. We found strong niche differentiation of anatomic habitat and microbial community turnover based on topographical distribution. Microbial community stability was documented up to two days after death. Additionally, we observed a positive relationship between cell motility and time since host death. Interestingly, we discovered evidence that microbial biodiversity is a predictor of antemortem host health condition (e.g., heart disease). These findings improve the understanding of postmortem host microbiota dynamics, and provide a robust dataset to test the postmortem microbiome as a tool for assessing health conditions in living populations.},

In the forensic field, the use of microbial DNA obtained from human materials is still in its infancy but has been suggested as a potential alternative in situations when other human (non-microbial) approaches present limitations. More specifically, DNA analysis of a wide variety of microorganisms that live in and on the human body offers promises to answer various forensically relevant questions, such as post-mortem interval estimation, individual identification, and tissue/body fluid identification, among others. However, human microbiome analysis currently faces significant challenges that need to be considered and overcome via future forensically oriented human microbiome research to provide the necessary solutions. In this perspective article, we discuss the most relevant biological, technical and data-related issues and propose future solutions that will pave the way towards the integration of human microbiome analysis in the forensic toolkit.},

ABSTRACT Numerous studies relate differences in microbial communities to human health and disease; however, little is known about microbial changes that occur postmortem or the possible applications of microbiome analysis in the field of forensic science. The aim of this review was to study the microbiome and its applications in forensic sciences and to determine the main lines of investigation that are emerging, as well as its possible contributions to the forensic field. A systematic review of the human microbiome in relation to forensic science was carried out by following PRISMA guidelines. This study sheds light on the role of microbiome research in the postmortem interval during the process of decomposition, identifying death caused by drowning or sudden death, locating the geographical location of death, establishing a connection between the human microbiome and personal items, sexual contact, and the identification of individuals. Actinomycetaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Alcaligenaceae, and Bacilli play an important role in determining the postmortem interval. Aeromonas can be used to determine the cause of death, and Corynebacterium or Helicobacter pylori can be used to ascertain personal identity or geographical location. Several studies point to a promising future for microbiome analysis in the different fields of forensic science, opening up an important new area of research.},

Total RNA from fresh and aged blood, menstrual blood, saliva, semen, skin and vaginal secretion was analyzed with a massively parallel sequencing method. Two RNA-Seq library protocols with and without rRNA depletion were tested and compared. The rRNA depletion step had a negative influence on the sequencing quality and on the downstream analyses. From the human and bacterial RNA sequences, source-specific signatures could be identified. Aged samples showed in general a higher level of RNA degradation and decreased bacterial diversity. In summary, we could show that transcriptional profiling and metagenome analysis are powerful tools to provide additional information about the trace evidence.},

abstract = {In recent years, forensic mRNA profiling has increasingly been used to identify the origin of human body fluids. By now, several laboratories have implemented mRNA profiling and also use it in criminal casework. In 2018 the FoRNAP (Forensic RNA Profiling) group was established among a number of these laboratories with the aim of sharing experiences, discussing optimization potential, identifying challenges and suggesting solutions with regards to mRNA profiling and casework. To compare mRNA profiling methods and results a collaborative exercise was organized within the FoRNAP group. Seven laboratories from four countries received 16 stains, comprising six pure body fluid / tissue stains and ten mock casework samples. The laboratories were asked to analyze the provided stains with their in-house method (PCR/CE or MPS) and markers of choice. Five laboratories used a DNA/RNA co-extraction strategy. Overall, up to 11 mRNA markers per body fluid were analyzed. We found that mRNA profiling using different extraction and analysis methods as well as different multiplexes can be applied to casework-like samples. In general, high input samples were typed with high accuracy by all laboratories, regardless of the method used. Irrespective of the analysis strategy, samples of low input or mixed stains were more challenging to analyze and interpret since, alike to DNA profiling, a higher number of markers dropped out and/or additional unexpected markers not consistent with the cell type in question were detected. It could be shown that a plethora of different but valid analysis and interpretation strategies exist and are successfully applied in the Forensic Genetics community. Nevertheless, efforts aiming at optimizing and harmonizing interpretation approaches in order to achieve a higher consistency between laboratories might be desirable in the future. The simultaneous extraction of DNA alongside RNA showed to be an effective approach to identify not only the body fluid present but also to identify the donor(s) of the stain. This allows investigators to gain valuable information about the origin of crime scene samples and the course of events in a crime case.},

abstract = {When mapped to the environments we interact with on a daily basis, the 36 million microbial cells per hour that humans emit leave a trail of evidence that can be leveraged for forensic analysis. We employed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to map unique microbial sequence variants between human skin and building surfaces in three experimental conditions: over time during controlled and uncontrolled incidental interactions with a door handle, and during multiple mock burglaries in ten real residences. We demonstrate that humans (n = 30) leave behind microbial signatures that can be used to track interaction with various surfaces within a building, but the likelihood of accurately detecting the specific burglar for a given home was between 20-25%. Also, the human microbiome contains rare microbial taxa that can be combined to create a unique microbial profile, which when compared to 600 other individuals can improve our ability to link an individual 'burglar' to a residence. In total, 5512 discriminating, non-singleton unique exact sequence variants (uESVs) were identified as unique to an individual, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 568, suggesting some people maintain a greater degree of unique taxa compared to our population of 600. Approximate 60-77% of the unique exact sequence variants originated from the hands of participants, and these microbial discriminators spanned 36 phyla but were dominated by the Proteobacteria (34%). A fitted regression generated to determine whether an intruder's uESVs found on door handles in an office decayed over time in the presence or absence of office workers, found no significant shift in proportion of uESVs over time irrespective of the presence of office workers. While it was possible to detect the correct burglars' microbiota as having contributed to the invaded space, the predictions were very weak in comparison to accepted forensic standards. This suggests that at this time 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the built environment microbiota cannot be used as a reliable trace evidence standard for criminal investigations.},

abstract = {Microbes have potential to be used as physical evidence for forensic science because they are ubiquitous and have predictable ecologies. With the advent of next generation sequencing technology and the subsequent boost to microbiome science (study of the genes and molecules of microbial communities), it has become possible to develop new microbial-based tools for forensic science. One promising approach is the use of microbial succession during the ecological process of decomposition to estimate the time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI). This microbial clock of death is developed by building a regression model using microbiome data collected from postmortem samples (e.g. swab of skin) with known PMIs. In a death investigation, a similar sample type (e.g. swab of skin) would be collected, the microbes profiled using DNA sequencing, and the microbes would be matched to a point on the clock (i.e. the regression model). Recent research by several independent scientific teams has provided a proof of concept for this new microbiome forensic tool. However, developing and transitioning new forensic science technologies into the justice system requires overcoming scientific, investigative, and legal hurdles. In this article, I address the apparent knowledge gaps in the science of microbiome technology to estimate PMI, and discuss a path for bringing this technology into the justice system.},

abstract = {Human DNA samples can remain unaltered for years and preserve important genetic information for forensic investigations. In fact, besides human genetic information, these extracts potentially contain additional valuable information: microbiome signatures. Forensic microbiology is rapidly becoming a significant tool for estimating post-mortem interval (PMI), and establishing cause of death and personal identity. To date, the possibility to recover unaltered microbiome signatures from human DNA extracts has not been proven. This study examines the microbiome signatures within human DNA extracts obtained from six cadavers with different PMIs, which were stored frozen for 5-16 years. Results demonstrated that the microbiome can be co-extracted with human DNA using forensic kits designed to extract the human host's DNA from different tissues and fluids during decomposition. We compared the microbial communities identified in these samples with microbial DNA recovered from two human cadavers donated to the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State University (FACTS) during multiple decomposition stages, to examine whether the microbial signatures recovered from "old" (up to 16 years) extracts are consistent with those identified in recently extracted microbial DNA samples. The V4 region of 16 S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq for all DNA extracts. The results obtained from the human DNA extracts were compared with each other and with the microbial DNA from the FACTS samples. Overall, we found that the presence of specific microbial taxa depends on the decomposition stage, the type of tissue, and the depositional environment. We found no indications of contamination in the microbial signatures, or any alterations attributable to the long-term frozen storage of the extracts, demonstrating that older human DNA extracts are a reliable source of such microbial signatures. No shared Core Microbiome (CM) was identified amongst the total 18 samples, but we identified certain species in association with the different decomposition stages, offering potential for the use of microbial signatures co-extracted with human DNA samples for PMI estimation in future. Unveiling the new significance of older human DNA extracts brings with it important ethical-legal considerations. Currently, there are no shared legal frameworks governing the long-term storage and use of human DNA extracts obtained from crime scene evidence for additional research purposes. It is therefore important to create common protocols on the storage of biological material collected at crime scenes. We review existing legislation and guidelines, and identify some important limitations for the further development and application of forensic microbiomics.},

abstract = {Background The human skin microbiome has been recently investigated as a potential forensic tool, as people leave traces of their potentially unique microbiomes on objects and surfaces with which they interact. In this metagenomic study of four people in Hong Kong, their homes, and public surfaces in their neighbourhoods, we investigated the stability and identifiability of these microbiota traces on a timescale of hours to days. Results Using a Canberra distance-based method of comparing skin and surface microbiomes, we found that a person could be accurately matched to their household in 84% of tests and to their neighbourhood in 50% of tests, and that matching accuracy did not decay for household surfaces over the 10-day study period, although it did for public surfaces. The time of day at which a skin or surface sample was taken affected matching accuracy, and 160 species across all sites were found to have a significant variation in abundance between morning and evening samples. We hypothesised that daily routines drive a rhythm of daytime dispersal from the pooled public surface microbiome followed by normalisation of a person’s microbiome by contact with their household microbial reservoir, and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) supported dispersal from public surfaces to skin as the major dispersal route among all sites studied. Conclusions These results suggest that in addition to considering the decay of microbiota traces with time, diurnal patterns in microbiome exposure that contribute to the human skin microbiome assemblage must also be considered in developing this as a potential forensic method.

abstract = {Microbes is becoming increasingly forensic possibility as a consequence of advances in massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and bioinformatics. Human DNA typing is the best identifier, but it is not always possible to extract a full DNA profile namely its degradation and low copy number, and it may have limitations for identical twins. To overcome these unsatisfactory limitations, forensic potential for bacteria found in evidence could be used to differentiate individuals. Prokaryotic cells have a cell wall that better protects the bacterial nucleoid compared to the cell membrane of eukaryotic cells. Humans have an extremely diverse microbiome that may prove useful in determining human identity and may even be possible to link the microbes to the person responsible for them. Microbial composition within the human microbiome varies across individuals. Therefore, MPS of human microbiome could be used to identify biological samples from the different individuals, specifically for twins and other cases where standard DNA typing doses not provide satisfactory results due to degradation of human DNA.

abstract = {There is a need for additional genetic information to help identify the source of biological evidence found at a crime scene. The human skin microbiome is a potentially abundant source of DNA that can enable the identification of a donor of biological evidence. ABSTRACT Microbial DNA, shed from human skin, can be distinctive to its host and, thus, help individualize donors of forensic biological evidence. Previous studies have utilized single-locus microbial DNA markers (e.g., 16S rRNA) to assess the presence/absence of personal microbiota to profile human hosts. However, since the taxonomic composition of the microbiome is in constant fluctuation, this approach may not be sufficiently robust for human identification (HID). Multimarker approaches may be more powerful. Additionally, genetic differentiation, rather than taxonomic distinction, may be more individualizing. To this end, the nondominant hands of 51 individuals were sampled in triplicate (n = 153). They were analyzed for markers in the hidSkinPlex, a multiplex panel comprising candidate markers for skin microbiome profiling. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the highest Wright’s fixation index (FST) estimates were then selected for predicting donor identity using a support vector machine (SVM) learning model. FST is an estimate of the genetic differences within and between populations. Three different SNP selection criteria were employed: SNPs with the highest-ranking FST estimates (i) common between any two samples regardless of markers present (termed overall); (ii) each marker common between samples (termed per marker); and (iii) common to all samples used to train the SVM algorithm for HID (termed selected). The SNPs chosen based on criteria for overall, per marker, and selected methods resulted in an accuracy of 92.00%, 94.77%, and 88.00%, respectively. The results support that estimates of FST, combined with SVM, can notably improve forensic HID via skin microbiome profiling. IMPORTANCE There is a need for additional genetic information to help identify the source of biological evidence found at a crime scene. The human skin microbiome is a potentially abundant source of DNA that can enable the identification of a donor of biological evidence. With microbial profiling for human identification, there will be an additional source of DNA to identify individuals as well as to exclude individuals wrongly associated with biological evidence, thereby improving the utility of forensic DNA profiling to support criminal investigations.},

abstract = {Information on the time when a stain was deposited at a crime scene can be valuable in forensic investigations. It can link a DNA-identified stain donor with a crime or provide a post-mortem interval estimation in cases with cadavers. The available methods for estimating stain deposition time have limitations of different types and magnitudes. In this proof-of-principle study we investigated for the first time the use of microbial DNA for this purpose in human saliva stains. First, we identified the most abundant and frequent bacterial species in saliva using publicly available 16S rRNA gene next generation sequencing (NGS) data from 1,848 samples. Next, we assessed time-dependent changes in 15 identified species using de-novo 16S rRNA gene NGS in the saliva stains of two individuals exposed to indoor conditions for up to 1 year. We selected four bacterial species, i.e., Fusobacterium periodonticum, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Veillonella dispar, and Veillonella parvula showing significant time-dependent changes and developed a 4-plex qPCR assay for their targeted analysis. Then, we analyzed the saliva stains of 15 individuals exposed to indoor conditions for up to 1 month. Bacterial counts generally increased with time and explained 54.9% of the variation (p = <2.2E–16). Time since deposition explained ≥86.5% and ≥88.9% of the variation in each individual and species, respectively (p = <2.2E–16). Finally, based on sample duplicates we built and tested multiple linear regression models for predicting the stain deposition time at an individual level, resulting in an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 5 days (ranging 3.3–7.8 days). Overall, the deposition time of 181 (81.5%) stains was correctly predicted within 1 week. Prediction models were also assessed in stains exposed to similar conditions up to 1 month 7 months later, resulting in an average MAE of 8.8 days (ranging 3.9–16.9 days). Our proof-of-principle study suggests the potential of the DNA profiling of human commensal bacteria as a method of estimating saliva stains time since deposition in the forensic scenario, which may be expanded to other forensically relevant tissues. The study considers practical applications of this novel approach, but various forensic developmental validation and implementation criteria will need to be met in more dedicated studies in the future.},

They are highly specific and can be used to differentiate and classify the originating body site of a human biological trace. Skin microbiota is also highly specific and different between individuals, leading to its possibility as an identification tool. By extension, the possibilities of the microbial communities to be deposited on everyday objects has also been explored. Other uses include the determination of the post-mortem interval or the analysis of soil communities. One challenge is that the microbiome changes over time and can be influenced by many environmental and lifestyle factors.

abstract = {The human skin microbiome can vary over time, and inter-individual variability of the microbiome is greater than the temporal variability within an individual. The skin microbiome has become a useful tool to identify individuals, and one type of personal identification using the skin microbiome has been reported in a community of less than 20 individuals. However, identification of individuals based on the skin microbiome has shown low accuracy in communities larger than 80 individuals. Here, we developed a new approach for personal identification, which considers that minor taxa are one of the important factors for distinguishing between individuals. We originally established a human skin microbiome for 66 samples from 11 individuals over two years (33 samples each year). Our method could classify individuals with 85% accuracy beyond a one-year sampling period. Moreover, we applied our method to 837 publicly available skin microbiome samples from 89 individuals and succeeded in identifying individuals with 78% accuracy. In short, our results investigate that (i) our new personal identification method worked well with two different communities (our data: 11 individuals; public data: 89 individuals) using the skin microbiome, (ii) defining the personal skin microbiome requires samples from several time points, (iii) inclusion of minor skin taxa strongly contributes to the effectiveness of personal identification.},

abstract = {Microbial forensics represents a promising tool to strengthen traditional forensic investigative methods and fill related knowledge gaps. Large-scale microbiome studies indicate that microbial fingerprinting can assist forensics in areas such as trace evidence, source tracking, geolocation, and circumstances of death. Nevertheless, the majority of forensic microbiome studies focus on soil and internal organ samples, whereas the microbiome of skin, mouth, and especially vaginal samples that are routinely collected in sexual assault and femicide cases remain underexplored. This review discusses the current and emerging insights into vaginal, skin, and salivary microbiome-modulating factors during life (e.g., lifestyle and health status) and after death (e.g., environmental influences and post-mortem interval) based on next-generation sequencing. We specifically highlight the key aspects of female reproductive tract, skin, and mouth microbiome samples relevant in forensics. To fill the current knowledge gaps, future research should focus on the degree to which the post-mortem succession rate and profiles of vaginal, skin, and saliva microbiota are sensitive to abiotic and biotic factors, presence or absence of oxygen and other gases, and the nutrient richness of the environment. Application of this microbiome-related knowledge could provide valuable complementary data to strengthen forensic cases, for example, to shed light on the circumstances surrounding death with (post-mortem) microbial fingerprinting. Overall, this review synthesizes the present knowledge and aims to provide a framework to adequately comprehend the hurdles and potential application of vaginal, skin, and salivary post-mortem microbiomes in forensic investigations.},

abstract = {16S rRNA profiling of bacterial communities may have forensic utility in the identification or association of individuals involved with criminal activities. Microbial profiling of evidence may, in the future, be performed within environments currently utilised for human DNA recovery, such as a forensic biology laboratory. It would be important to establish the background microbiome of such an environment to determine the potential presence of human or environmental microbial signatures to assist forensic scientists in the appropriate interpretation of target microbial communities. This study sampled various surfaces of an Evidence Recovery Laboratory (ERL) on three occasions including (a) before a monthly deep-clean, (b) immediately following the deep-clean, and (c) immediately after the laboratory's use by a single participant for the purposes of routine item examinations. Microbial profiles were also generated for the involved participant and researcher for comparison purposes. Additionally, human nuclear DNA was profiled for each of the samples collected, using standard forensic profiling techniques, to provide a prospective link to the presence or absence of a background microbial signature within the ERL after its use. Taxonomic distributions across ERL samples revealed no consistent signature of any of the items sampled over time, however, major phyla noted within all ERL samples across the three timepoints were consistent with those found in human skin microbiomes. PCoA plots based on the Unweighted Unifrac metric revealed some clustering between participant microbial reference samples and surfaces of the ERL after use, suggesting that despite a lack of direct contact, and adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) suitable for human DNA recovery, microbiomes may be deposited into a forensic setting over time. The reference samples collected from the involved participant and researcher generated full STR profiles. Human DNA was observed to varying degrees in samples taken from the ERL across each of the sampling timepoints. There was no correlation observed between samples that contained or did not contain detectable quantities of human nuclear DNA and microbial profile outputs.},

abstract = {The human microbiome encompasses the fungi, bacteria and viruses that live on, within, and immediately surrounding the body. Microbiomes have potential utility in forensic science as an evidentiary tool to link or exclude persons of interest associated with criminal activities. Research has shown the microbiome is individualised, and that personal microbial signatures can be recovered from surfaces such as phones, shoes and fabrics. Before the human microbiome may be used as an investigative tool, further research is required to investigate the utility and potential limitations surrounding microbial profiling. This includes the detectability of microbial transfer between individuals or items, the associated risks (such as contamination events) and the applicability of microbial profiling for forensic purposes. This research aimed to identify whether an individual's distinguishable microbiome could be transferred to another individual and onto substrates, and vice versa. Paper, cotton, and glass surfaces were chosen to represent a range of substrate matrices. The study involved six participants placed into three pairs; participants took part in two modes of transfer. Transfer Mode 1 involved the pair shaking hands, followed by rubbing a substrate in their right hand. Transfer Mode 2 involved individuals rubbing a substrate in their left hand, swapping substrates with their partner and then rubbing the swapped substrate in their left hand. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on the extracted microbial DNA from participant and substrate samples. Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME 2) was used for sequence quality control and beta (between-sample) diversity analyses and taxonomic assignment. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) based on Jaccard distances was visualised through Emperor software to determine the phylogenetic similarity of bacterial communities between participants and among participant pairs. Statistical testing through PERMANOVA revealed significant differences in the Jaccard distances between each participant pair (P < 0.001), highlighting not only the potential distinguishability of skin microbiomes among individuals, but also the clustering effect observed between participant pairs due to the potential transfer of hand-associated microbiomes between individuals. The study demonstrated that transfer of the human skin microbiome had occurred between all participant pairs, regardless of substrate type or mode of transfer.},

abstract = {In a previous study we presented an assay for targeted mRNA sequencing for the identification of human body fluids, optimised for the Illumina MiSeq/FGx MPS platform. This assay, together with an additional in-house designed assay for the Ion Torrent PGM/S5 platform, was the basis for a collaborative exercise within 17 EUROFORGEN and EDNAP laboratories, in order to test the efficacy of targeted mRNA sequencing to identify body fluids. The task was to analyse the supplied dried body fluid stains and, optionally, participants' own bona fide or mock casework samples of human origin, according to specified protocols. The provided primer pools for the Illumina MiSeq/FGx and the Ion Torrent PGM/S5 platforms included 33 and 29 body fluid specific targets, respectively, to identify blood, saliva, semen, vaginal secretion, menstrual blood and skin. The results demonstrated moderate to high count values in the body fluid or tissue of interest with little to no counts in non-target body fluids. There was some inter-laboratory variability in read counts, but overall the results of the laboratories were comparable in that highly expressed markers showed high read counts and less expressed markers showed lower counts. We performed a partial least squares (PLS) analysis on the data, where blood, menstrual blood, saliva and semen markers and samples clustered well. The results of this collaborative mRNA massively parallel sequencing (MPS) exercise support targeted mRNA sequencing as a reliable body fluid identification method that could be added to the repertoire of forensic MPS panels.},

The resulting data set was used to build a probabilistic model that predicts the origin of a stain. Our approach uses partial least squares followed by linear discriminant analysis to classify samples into six commonly occurring forensic body fluids. The model differs from the ones previously suggested in that it incorporates quantitative information (NGS read counts) rather than just presence/absence of markers. The suggested approach also allows for visualisation of important markers and their correlation with the different body fluids. We compared our model to previously published methods to show that the inclusion of read count information improves the prediction. Finally, we applied the model to mixed body fluid samples to test its ability to identify the individual components in a mixture.},

abstract = {Abstract Purpose: Determining the post-mortem interval (PMI) is one of the challenging tasks in forensic science due to the lack of quick and inexpensive methods. Our objective is to develop innovative and alternative means for PMI evaluation. Methods: The relationship between PMI and enzymatic modifications in mice tissues was described. After being sacrificed, Swiss mice were randomly divided into groups according to the time elapsed since death. The activities of catalase (CAT) and δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) were determined in hepatic, renal, skeletal muscle and cerebral tissues. Results: CAT activity increased in kidney and brain 6 h after death and this increase remained for up to 24 h in the brain and 48 h in the kidney. δ-ALA-D had its activity decreased in the liver and kidneys in 6 h. In the skeletal muscle, δ-ALA-D activity was reduced only 48 h after death. Conversely, an increase on δ-ALA-D activity was observed in the brain at 6 h, followed by its decrease at 24 and 48 h. Conclusion: With the association of this set of results, it is possible to provide an estimate of PMI. Additionally, these results can be used as an auxiliary parameter associated with other methods to estimate PMI.},

abstract = {In recent years, it has become a new research direction to post-mortem interval (PMI) estimation from the changes in metabolite content generated during the process of cadaver corruption, and lead to more and more attention has been paid to the biochemical changes of muscles after death. The ATP degradation process has long been accepted as a precise manner to estimate freshness of meat products in food science. ATP-related metabolites may also serve as an indicator for PMI estimation of corpses. The purpose of this study was to test this possibility. Firstly, this study optimized the detection method of ATP-related metabolites in skeletal muscles of rat. Moreover, in animal experiment, ATP-related metabolites (ATP, ADP, AMP, IMP, Ino, Hx) in lower hind limb skeletal muscles of sixty rats were measured by RP-HPLC at different PMI for 168 h at 20 °C ± 1 °C, the change of freshness indicators (K value, K1 value, K0 value, H value, P value, G value, IMP ratio) were carefully analyzed, and investigate the relationship between them and PMI. The overall results showed that IMP, AMP, Hx, Total metabolites, K value, K1 value, K0 value, H value, P value, G value, and IMP ratio in skeletal muscles changed significantly with PMI (R2 = 0.864-0.971, all P < 0.01) while ATP, ADP, Ino, IMP precursors and IMP degradants had minor changes during the same period (R2 = 0.171-0.706). Specifically, significant linear positive correlations between H value of skeletal muscles and PMI were found, and the coefficients of their regression functions were R2 = 0.971. The correlation between AMP and PMI was slightly lower (R2 = 0.864), but the scope of PMI estimation was the widest (168 h). It can be concluded that the determination of ATP-related metabolites in skeletal muscle may be a potential tool in the PMI estimation. However, more researches on its influencing factors are needed to facilitate its final use in practice.},

Yet, there is no reliable method for the inference / assessment of TsD available. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the RNA degradation pattern of forensically relevant body fluids and to find candidate markers for TsD estimation. Blood, menstrual blood, saliva, semen and vaginal secretion samples were exposed to indoor (dark, room temperature) and outdoor (exposed to sun, wind, etc. but protected from rain) conditions for up to 1.5 years. Based on expression and degradation analyses, we were able to identify body fluid specific signatures and RNA degradation patterns. The indoor samples showed a marked drop in RNA integrity after 6 months, while the outdoor samples were difficult to interpret and therefore excluded for some of the analyses. Up to 4 weeks, indoor samples showed more stable and less degrading transcripts than outdoor samples. Stable transcripts tended to be significantly shorter than degrading ones or transcripts, which are neither degrading nor stable. We reinforced the body fluid specific and the housekeeping gene nature of previously reported markers. With an unbiased approach, we selected stable and degrading genes for each body fluid in the short term and assessed their integrity during extended storage. We identified several stable and degrading gene transcripts, which could be tested in a targeted assay to assess the TsD interval e.g. by analyzing the ratio of degrading vs stable transcripts. In conclusion, we were able to detect RNA degradation patterns in samples being aged up to 1.5 years and identified several candidate markers, which could be evaluated for TsD estimation.},
