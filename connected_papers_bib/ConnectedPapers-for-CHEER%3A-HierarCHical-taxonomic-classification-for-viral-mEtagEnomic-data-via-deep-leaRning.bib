abstract = {MOTIVATION
We expect novel pathogens to arise due to their fast-paced evolution, and new species to be discovered thanks to advances in DNA sequencing and metagenomics. Moreover, recent developments in synthetic biology raise concerns that some strains of bacteria could be modified for malicious purposes. Traditional approaches to open-view pathogen detection depend on databases of known organisms, which limits their performance on unknown, unrecognized, and unmapped sequences. In contrast, machine learning methods can infer pathogenic phenotypes from single NGS reads, even though the biological context is unavailable.


RESULTS
We present DeePaC, a Deep Learning Approach to Pathogenicity Classification. It includes a flexible framework allowing easy evaluation of neural architectures with reverse-complement parameter sharing. We show that convolutional neural networks and LSTMs outperform the state-of-the-art based on both sequence homology and machine learning. Combining a deep learning approach with integrating the predictions for both mates in a read pair results in cutting the error rate almost in half in comparison to the previous state-of-the-art.

What is more, recent developments in synthetic biology raise concerns that some strains of bacteria could be modified for malicious purposes. Traditional approaches to open-view pathogen detection depend on databases of known organisms, limiting their performance on unknown, unrecognized, and unmapped sequences. In contrast, machine learning methods can infer pathogenic phenotypes from single NGS reads even though the biological context is unavailable. However, modern neural architectures treat DNA as a simple character string and may predict conflicting labels for a given sequence and its reverse-complement. This undesirable property may impact model performance. Results: We present DeePaC, a Deep Learning Approach to Pathogenicity Classification. It includes a universal, extensible framework for neural architectures ensuring identical predictions for any given DNA sequence and its reverse-complement. We implement reverse-complement convolutional neural networks and LSTMs, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods based on both sequence homology and machine learning. Combining a reverse-complement architecture with integrating the predictions for both mates in a read pair results in cutting the error rate almost in half in comparison to the previous state-of-the-art.

abstract = {Close set is a hypothesis utilized by the majority of machine-learning-based (ML-based) recognition algorithms, assuming all testing classes are known at training time. In real world, the more practical model is Open Set Recognition (OSR), which allows the presence of unknown classes at testing time, but requires the rejection ability of the model. The compact abating probability (CAP) model, which assumes the probability of class membership decreases in value (abates) as points move from known data toward open space, is first raised in traditional ML-based OSR method and soon become the basis of majority of later developed works. Most of convolutional-neural-network-based (CNN-based) OSR methods also adopted this model as their basis. During our exploration, however, we find that the application of CAP model to the CNN-based OSR method is restricted by the difference of its feature space from that of ML-based method. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group who find this gap. To fill this gap, we propose a method called OpenSoftMax to transform the CNN-based methods' features by the process of SoftMax. In order to investigate performance, we further implement quantitative comparison between our OpenSoftMax method and the well-known CNN-based method OpenMax on caltech256 datasets. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposals.},

abstract = {Abstract We propose a Convolutional Neural Network approach based on k-mer representation for metagenomic fragment classification problem. The proposed model consists of two steps; the first step is representation of DNA based on k-mer frequency with Relative Abundance Index (RAI) and the second step is classification metagenomic fragments with CNN. RAI scores, as DNA fragment representations are fed to CNN classifiers (CNN-RAI). RAI consist of the over- and under abundance statistics gathered from the taxon for each k-mer. In order to compare the performances of CNN-RAI and RAIphy, which classifies metagenomic fragments using the same input attributes with an expectation-maximization based approach, databases of different metagenomic scenarios were tested. Metagenomics data that were generated (or simulated) by different Next-Generation Sequencing platforms, respectively Illumina technology and Oxford Nanopore MinION were compiled into shotgun metagenomics or 16S rRNA datasets. RAI based method and CNN models were trained on represented data with read lengths ranging between 200 and 10,000 bp, also with distinct k-mer size ( 3 ≤ k ≤ 7 ) at genus level. RAI score was used for the first time in the deep learning algorithm as a spectral representation with improved performance thanks to the ability of deep learning on each dataset for a range of parameters. The proposed representation was compared to the current spectral methods and shown to be competitive for all datasets used in this study.},

abstract = {Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. Further, we develop a suite of interpretability tools and show that it can be applied also to other models beyond the host prediction task. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect regions of interest in novel agents, for example the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

 Abstract
 
 The fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data has contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignment-based and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools. The source code, scripts, and pre-trained parameters for CHEER are available via GitHub:https://github.com/KennthShang/CHEER.

abstract = {Abstract CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a key regulator of 3D genome organization and gene expression. Recent studies suggest that RNA transcripts, mostly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), can serve as locus-specific factors to bind and recruit CTCF to the chromatin. However, it remains unclear whether specific sequence patterns are shared by the CTCF-binding RNA sites, and no RNA motif has been reported so far for CTCF binding. In this study, we have developed DeepLncCTCF, a new deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network and a bidirectional long short-term memory network, to discover the RNA recognition patterns of CTCF and identify candidate lncRNAs binding to CTCF. When evaluated on two different datasets, human U2OS dataset and mouse ESC dataset, DeepLncCTCF was shown to be able to accurately predict CTCF-binding RNA sites from nucleotide sequence. By examining the sequence features learned by DeepLncCTCF, we discovered a novel RNA motif with the consensus sequence, AGAUNGGA, for potential CTCF binding in humans. Furthermore, the applicability of DeepLncCTCF was demonstrated by identifying nearly 5000 candidate lncRNAs that might bind to CTCF in the nucleus. Our results provide useful information for understanding the molecular mechanisms of CTCF function in 3D genome organization.},

In the present study, a Nrf2 homolog was newly identified in the thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus. Accordingly, its functional role in antioxidant defense in response to acute benzo(a)pyrene (Bap) exposure was assessed. The newly identified McNrf2 affiliated to traditional Nrf2 family through Blast, multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis. After acute exposure to Bap, antioxidants including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathine reductase (GR) were significantly induced in gills and digestive glands at both mRNA and enzymatic levels, and the expression of McNrf2 mRNA was also up-regulated. The analysis of correlating the expression of McNrf2 and the mRNA levels of these antioxidant genes showed positive ties, indicating that Nrf2 was needed for protracted induction of such genes. Further, the recombinant McNrf2 was produced through pET-32a prokaryotic system. After 50 μg/L Bap exposure, ROS generation and LPO level in gills of Nrf2 over-expressed mussels significantly decreased compared to Nrf2 wild-type mussels, as well as reduced ROS production in digestive glands. Collectively, these results show that Nrf2 pathway can provide protection from oxidative stress triggered by Bap in the thick shell mussel.},

abstract = {Certain bacteria selectively attack tumor tissues and trigger tumor shrinkage by producing toxins and modulating the local immune system, but their clinical utility is limited because of the dangers posed by systemic infection. Genetic engineering can be used to minimize the risks associated with tumor-targeting pathogens, as well as to increase their efficiency in killing tumor cells. Advances in genetic circuit design have led to the development of bacterial strains with enhanced tumor-targeting capacities and the ability to secrete therapeutics, cytotoxic proteins and prodrug-cleaving enzymes, which allows their safe and effective use for cancer treatment. The present review details the recent advances in the design and application of these modified bacterial strains.},

abstract = {Abstract An increasing number of scientists are turning to the microbiota to understand and/or explain the origin of various human metabolic or inflammatory diseases. Oxygen-intolerant bacteria represent the major population of the human intestinal microbiota. Their isolation is often difficult or even fastidious. The number of studies showing their beneficial role in human health is growing exponentially. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia muciniphila are abundantly represented in healthy intestinal microbiota and their imbalance is positively correlated with inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders (obesity, diabetes, cancers). Their use as probiotics presents very promising results in restoring the balance of microbial flora but also in the treatment of certain pathological conditions. The Christensenellaceae family has recently emerged as a hereditary taxon and studies have shown that its abundance is positively correlated with leanness and controls obesity in recipient mice. Here, we report the different culture strategies and techniques used for their isolation; the role of antioxidants in the survival of these oxygen-sensitive species in clinical sample and their maintenance in culture isolates.},

Endophytic bacteria associated with algae associated have been shown to be particularly promising candidates. In a previous study, a crude protein extract was isolated from an endophytic Vibrio sp . strain ES25. The extract was found to have anti-microbial activity. Despite these promising results, further work was needed to characterize both the protein and the bacteria that produce it. In this study, we sought to increase the activity of the previously discovered protein through pepsin digestion as well as provide sequence data to characterize the bacterial isolate. Here, we show promising evidence that the hydrolysate produced (QA1d) was found to have a promising antimicrobial as well as anticancer properties. Through the DNA sequencing, we also provide better taxonomic information on the isolate. Finally using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy/Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) and in silico prediction, we identify to novel peptides produced from the bacterial protein that were predicted to have multifunctional activity. These results shown here indicate these peptides are promising candidates for anticancer drug development or antibacterial agents for the food industry.},

abstract = {One of the most delicate stages of an evolutionary algorithm is the evaluation of the goodness of the solutions by some procedure providing a fitness value. However, although there are general rules, it is not always easy to find an appropriate evaluation function for a given problem. In the biological realm, today, there is a variety of experimental methods under the name of microbial screening to identify and select bacteria from their traits, as well as to obtain their fitness. In this paper, we show how given an optimization problem, a colony of synthetic bacteria or bacterial agents is able to evaluate the fitness of candidate solutions by building an evaluation function. The evaluation function is obtained simulating, in silico, a bacterial colony conducting the laboratory methods used in microbiology, biotechnology and synthetic biology to measure microbial fitness. Once the evaluation function is built, it is included in the code of the genetic algorithm as part of the fitness routine. The practical use of this approach is illustrated in two classic optimization problems. In silico routines have been programmed in Gro, a cell programming language oriented to synthetic biology, and can easily be customized to many other optimization problems.},

Machine learning is a promising in-silico tool used to simulate cells with specific disease properties and to determine their response toward drug uptake. Differences in the properties of normal and infected cells, including biophysical, biochemical and physiological characteristics, plays a key role in developing fundamental cellular probing platforms for machine learning applications. Cellular features can be extracted periodically from both the drug treated, infected, and normal cells via image segmentations in order to probe dynamic differences in cell behavior. Cellular segmentation can be evaluated to reflect the levels of drug effect on a distinct cell or group of cells via probability scoring. This article provides an account for the use of machine learning methods to probe differences in the biophysical, biochemical and physiological characteristics of infected cells in response to pharmacokinetics uptake of drug ingredients for application in cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease therapies.},

abstract = {Motivation Biological sequence classification is the most fundamental task in bioinformatics analysis. For example, in metagenome analysis, binning is a typical type of DNA sequence classification. In order to classify sequences, it is necessary to define sequence features. The k-mer frequency, base composition, and alignment-based metrics are commonly used. In contrast, in the field of image recognition using machine learning, image classification is broadly divided into those based on shape and those based on style. A style matrix was introduced as a method of expressing the style of an image (e.g., color usage and texture). Results We propose a novel sequence feature, called genomic style, inspired by image classification approaches, for classifying and clustering DNA sequences. As with the style of images, the DNA sequence is considered to have a genomic style unique to the bacterial species, and the style matrix concept is applied to the DNA sequence. Our main aim is to introduce the genomics style as yet another basic sequence feature for metagenome binning problem in replace of the most commonly used sequence feature k-mer frequency. Performance evaluations show that our method using style matrix achieves the superior accuracy than state-of-the-art binning tools based on k-mer frequency.},

abstract = {BackgroundMetagenomics sequencing provides deep insights into microbial communities. To investigate their taxonomic structure, binning assembled contigs into discrete clusters is critical. Many binning algorithms have been developed, but their performance is not always satisfactory, especially for complex microbial communities, calling for further development.ResultsAccording to previous studies, relative sequence compositions are similar across different regions of the same genome, but they differ between distinct genomes. Generally, current tools have used the normalized frequency of k-tuples directly, but this represents an absolute, not relative, sequence composition. Therefore, we attempted to model contigs using relative k-tuple composition, followed by measuring dissimilarity between contigs using d2S$$ {d}_2^S $$. The d2S$$ {d}_2^S $$ was designed to measure the dissimilarity between two long sequences or Next-Generation Sequencing data with the Markov models of the background genomes. This method was effective in revealing group and gradient relationships between genomes, metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. With many binning tools available, we do not try to bin contigs from scratch. Instead, we developed d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$ to adjust contigs among bins based on the output of existing binning tools for a single metagenomic sample. The tool is taxonomy-free and depends only on k-tuples. To evaluate the performance of d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$, five widely used binning tools with different strategies of sequence composition or the hybrid of sequence composition and abundance were selected to bin six synthetic and real datasets, after which d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$ was applied to adjust the binning results. Our experiments showed that d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$ consistently achieves the best performance with tuple length k = 6 under the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) background model. Using the metrics of recall, precision and ARI (Adjusted Rand Index), d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$ improves the binning performance in 28 out of 30 testing experiments (6 datasets with 5 binning tools). The d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$ is available at https://github.com/kunWangkun/d2SBin.ConclusionsExperiments showed that d2S$$ {d}_2^S $$ accurately measures the dissimilarity between contigs of metagenomic reads and that relative sequence composition is more reasonable to bin the contigs. The d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$ can be applied to any existing contig-binning tools for single metagenomic samples to obtain better binning results.},

abstract = {N6-methyladenine (6mA) is an important DNA modification form associated with a wide range of biological processes. Identifying accurately 6mA sites on a genomic scale is crucial for under-standing of 6mA’s biological functions. However, the existing experimental techniques for detecting 6mA sites are cost-ineffective, which implies the great need of developing new computational methods for this problem. In this paper, we developed, without requiring any prior knowledge of 6mA and manually crafted sequence features, a deep learning framework named Deep6mA to identify DNA 6mA sites, and its performance is superior to other DNA 6mA prediction tools. Specifically, the 5-fold cross-validation on a benchmark dataset of rice gives the sensitivity and specificity of Deep6mA as 92.96% and 95.06%, respectively, and the overall prediction accuracy is 94%. Importantly, we find that the sequences with 6mA sites share similar patterns across different species. The model trained with rice data predicts well the 6mA sites of other three species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Fragaria vesca and Rosa chinensis with a prediction accuracy over 90%. In addition, we find that (1) 6mA tends to occur at GAGG motifs, which means the sequence near the 6mA site may be conservative; (2) 6mA is enriched in the TATA box of the promoter, which may be the main source of its regulating downstream gene expression.},

abstract = {Objective To develop a deep learning-based model using esophageal thickness to detect esophageal cancer from unenhanced chest CT images. Methods We retrospectively identified 141 patients with esophageal cancer and 273 patients negative for esophageal cancer (at the time of imaging) for model training. Unenhanced chest CT images were collected and used to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for diagnosing esophageal cancer. The CNN is a VB-Net segmentation network that segments the esophagus and automatically quantifies the thickness of the esophageal wall and detect positions of esophageal lesions. To validate this model, 52 false negatives and 48 normal cases were collected further as the second dataset. The average performance of three radiologists and that of the same radiologists aided by the model were compared. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the esophageal cancer detection model were 88.8% and 90.9%, respectively, for the validation dataset set. Of the 52 missed esophageal cancer cases and the 48 normal cases, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the deep learning esophageal cancer detection model were 69%, 61%, and 65%, respectively. The independent results of the radiologists had a sensitivity of 25%, 31%, and 27%; specificity of 78%, 75%, and 75%; and accuracy of 53%, 54%, and 53%. With the aid of the model, the results of the radiologists were improved to a sensitivity of 77%, 81%, and 75%; specificity of 75%, 74%, and 74%; and accuracy of 76%, 77%, and 75%, respectively. Conclusions Deep learning-based model can effectively detect esophageal cancer in unenhanced chest CT scans to improve the incidental detection of esophageal cancer.},

abstract = {A 57-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of a left anterior neck mass. It was nonpainful and did not cause dysphagia, hoarseness, or difficulty breathing. Physical examination was significant for a firm, well-circumscribed, nonulcerating mass at left level 1B, with no overlying skin changes. Additionally, he had asymmetric left tonsillar hypertrophy. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast revealed lymphadenopathy involving left level l B measuring 3.1 cm (figure 1) and left supraclavicular fossameasuring 2.1 em, as well as asymmetric fullness of the left palatine tonsil. The patient proceeded with bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy, direct laryngoscopy, tonsillectomy, and open neck biopsy. Right tonsil, left tonsil. and level IB lymph node surgical specimens were sent for review. Histologically, the lymph node showed an overall increase ofsmall atrophic follicles.The mantle zone was expanded, forming an "onion-skin"appearance that was penetrated by hyalinized vessels at a right angle (figure 2, A) .

abstract = {Background For stage IV patients harboring EGFR mutations, there is a differential response to the first-line TKI treatment. We constructed three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) with deep transfer learning to stratify patients into subgroups with different response and progression risks. Materials and Methods From 2013 to 2017, 339 patients with EGFR mutation receiving first-line TKI treatment were included. Progression-free survival (PFS) time and progression patterns were confirmed by routine follow-up and restaging examinations. Patients were divided into two subgroups according to the median PFS (<=9 months, > 9 months). We developed a PFS prediction model and a progression pattern classification model using transfer learning from a pre-trained EGFR mutation classification 3D CNN. Clinical features were fused with the 3D CNN to build the final hybrid prediction model. The performance was quantified using area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and model performance was compared by AUCs with Delong test. Results The PFS prediction CNN showed an AUC of 0.744 (95% CI, 0.645–0.843) in the independent validation set and the hybrid model of CNNs and clinical features showed an AUC of 0.771 (95% CI, 0.676–0.866), which are significantly better than clinical features-based model (AUC, 0.624, P<0.01). The progression pattern prediction model showed an AUC of 0.762(95% CI, 0.643–0.882) and the hybrid model with clinical features showed an AUC of 0.794 (95% CI, 0.681–0.908), which can provide compensate information for clinical features-based model (AUC, 0.710; 95% CI, 0.582–0.839). Conclusion The CNN exhibits potential ability to stratify progression status in patients with EGFR mutation treated with first-line TKI, which might help make clinical decisions.},
