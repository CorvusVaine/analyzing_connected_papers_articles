abstract = {The reconstruction of microbial genomes from large metagenomic datasets is a critical procedure for finding uncultivated microbial populations and defining their microbial functional roles. To achieve that, we need to perform metagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes. Despite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important property of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the metagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep Contrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can efficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and robust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add simulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to produce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the distorted data. Consequently, the trained model will be robust to noise and handle it implicitly during usage. CLMB outperforms the previous state-of-the-art binning methods significantly, recovering the most near-complete genomes on almost all the benchmarking datasets (up to 17% more reconstructed genomes compared to the second-best method). It also improves the performance of bin refinement, reconstructing 8-22 more high-quality genomes and 15-32 more middle-quality genomes than the second-best result. Impressively, in addition to being compatible with the binning refiner, single CLMB even recovers on average 15 more HQ genomes than the refiner of VAMB and Maxbin on the benchmarking datasets. On a real mother-infant microbiome dataset with 110 samples, CLMB is scalable and practical to recover 365 high-quality and middle-quality genomes (including 21 new ones), providing insights into the microbiome transmission. CLMB is open-source and available at https://github.com/zpf0117b/CLMB/.},

abstract = {Background Total DNA (intracellular, iDNA and extracellular, eDNA) from ancient permafrost records the mixed genetic repository of the past and present microbial populations through geological time. Given the exceptional preservation of eDNA under perennial frozen conditions, typical metagenomic sequencing of total DNA precludes the discrimination between fossil and living microorganisms in ancient cryogenic environments. DNA repair protocols were combined with high throughput sequencing (HTS) of separate iDNA and eDNA fraction to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from ancient microbial DNA entrapped in Siberian coastal permafrost. Results Despite the severe DNA damage in ancient permafrost, the coupling of DNA repair and HTS resulted in a total of 52 MAGs from sediments across a chronosequence (26–120 kyr). These MAGs were compared with those derived from the same samples but without utilizing DNA repair protocols. The MAGs from the youngest stratum showed minimal DNA damage and thus likely originated from viable, active microbial species. Many MAGs from the older and deeper sediment appear related to past aerobic microbial populations that had died upon freezing. MAGs from anaerobic lineages, including Asgard archaea, however exhibited minimal DNA damage and likely represent extant living microorganisms that have become adapted to the cryogenic and anoxic environments. The integration of aspartic acid racemization modeling and metaproteomics further constrained the metabolic status of the living microbial populations. Collectively, combining DNA repair protocols with HTS unveiled the adaptive strategies of microbes to long-term survivability in ancient permafrost. Conclusions Our results indicated that coupling of DNA repair protocols with simultaneous sequencing of iDNA and eDNA fractions enabled the assembly of MAGs from past and living microorganisms in ancient permafrost. The genomic reconstruction from the past and extant microbial populations expanded our understanding about the microbial successions and biogeochemical alterations from the past paleoenvironment to the present-day frozen state. Furthermore, we provided genomic insights into long-term survival mechanisms of microorganisms under cryogenic conditions through geological time. The combined strategies in this study can be extrapolated to examine other ancient non-permafrost environments and constrain the search for past and extant extraterrestrial life in permafrost and ice deposits on Mars.

abstract = {Despite recent advances in metagenomic binning, reconstruction of microbial species from metagenomics data remains challenging. Here we develop variational autoencoders for metagenomic binning (VAMB), a program that uses deep variational autoencoders to encode sequence coabundance and k -mer distribution information before clustering. We show that a variational autoencoder is able to integrate these two distinct data types without any previous knowledge of the datasets. VAMB outperforms existing state-of-the-art binners, reconstructing 29–98% and 45% more near-complete (NC) genomes on simulated and real data, respectively. Furthermore, VAMB is able to separate closely related strains up to 99.5% average nucleotide identity (ANI), and reconstructed 255 and 91 NC Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei sample-specific genomes as two distinct clusters from a dataset of 1,000 human gut microbiome samples. We use 2,606 NC bins from this dataset to show that species of the human gut microbiome have different geographical distribution patterns. VAMB can be run on standard hardware and is freely available at https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb .

abstract = {Technological developments have led to an explosion of high-throughput single cell data, which are revealing unprecedented perspectives on cell identity. Recently, significant attention has focused on investigating, from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, cellular dynamic processes, such as cell differentiation, cell cycle and cell (de)activation. Trajectory inference methods estimate a trajectory, a collection of differentiation paths of a dynamic system, by ordering cells along the paths of such a dynamic process. While trajectory inference tools typically work with gene expression levels, common scRNA-seq protocols allow the identification and quantification of unspliced pre-mRNAs and mature spliced mRNAs, for each gene. By exploiting the abundance of unspliced and spliced mRNA, one can infer the RNA velocity of individual cells, i.e., the time derivative of the gene expression state of cells. Whereas traditional trajectory inference methods reconstruct cellular dynamics given a population of cells of varying maturity, RNA velocity relies on a dynamical model describing splicing dynamics. Here, we initially discuss conceptual and theoretical aspects of both approaches, then illustrate how they can be combined together, and finally present an example use-case on real data.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Hi-C technology provides insights into the 3D organization of the chromatin, and the single-cell Hi-C method enables researchers to gain knowledge about the chromatin state in individual cell levels. Single-cell Hi-C interaction matrices are high dimensional and very sparse. To cluster thousands of single-cell Hi-C interaction matrices, they are flattened and compiled into one matrix. Depending on the resolution, this matrix can have a few million or even billions of features; therefore, computations can be memory intensive. We present a single-cell Hi-C clustering approach using an approximate nearest neighbors method based on locality-sensitive hashing to reduce the dimensions and the computational resources.


RESULTS
The presented method can process a 10 kb single-cell Hi-C data set with 2600 cells and needs 40 GB of memory, while competitive approaches are not computable even with 1 TB of memory. It can be shown that the differentiation of the cells by their chromatin folding properties and, therefore, the quality of the clustering of single-cell Hi-C data is advantageous compared to competitive algorithms.


AVAILABILITY
The presented clustering algorithm is part of the scHiCExplorer, is available on Github https://github.com/joachimwolff/scHiCExplorer, and as a conda package via the bioconda channel. The approximate nearest neighbors implementation is available via https://github.com/joachimwolff/sparse-neighbors-search and as a conda package via the bioconda channel.

abstract = {Recombination is one of the essential genetic processes for sexually reproducing organisms, which can happen more frequently in some regions, called recombination hotspots. Although several factors, such as PRDM9 binding motifs, are known to be related to the hotspots, their contributions to the recombination hotspots have not been quantified, and other determinants are yet to be elucidated. Here, we develop a computational method, RHSNet, based on deep learning and signal processing, to identify and quantify the hotspot determinants in a purely data-driven manner, utilizing datasets from various studies, populations, sexes, and species. In addition to being able to identify hotspot regions and the well-known determinants accurately, RHSNet is sensitive to the difference between different PRDM9 alleles and different sexes, and can generalize to PRDM9-lacking species. The cross-sex, cross-population, and cross-species studies suggest that the proposed method has the potential to identify and quantify the evolutionary determinant motifs. Teaser RHSNet can accurately identify and quantify recombination hotspot determinants across different studies, sexes, populations, and species.},

abstract = {The gut microbiome is associated with human diseases and interacts with dietary components and drugs. In vivo mouse models may be effective for studying diet and drug effects on the gut microbiome. We constructed a mouse reference gut microbiome (MRGM, https://www.mbiomenet.org/MRGM/) that includes newly-assembled genomes from 878 metagenomes. Leveraging samples with ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing (>130 million read pairs), we demonstrated quality improvement in assembled genomes for mouse gut microbes as sequencing depth increased. MRGM provides a catalog of 46,267 non-redundant genomes with ≥70% completeness and ≤5% contamination comprising 1,689 representative bacterial species and 15.2 million non-redundant proteins. Importantly, MRGM significantly improved the taxonomic classification rate of sequencing reads from mouse fecal samples compared to previous databases. Using MRGM, we determined that reliable low-abundance taxa profiles of the mouse gut microbiome require sequencing >10 million reads. Despite the high overall functional similarity of the mouse and human gut microbiomes, only ~10% of MRGM species are shared with the human gut microbiome. Although ~80% of MRGM genera are present in the human gut microbiome, ~70% of the shared genera have <40% of core gene content for the respective genus with human counterparts. These suggest that although metabolic processes of the human gut microbiome largely occur in the mouse gut microbiome, functional translations between them according to genus-level taxonomic commonality require caution. Key Points MRGM provides 46,267 genomes comprising 1,689 bacterial species of mouse gut microbiome. Despite high overlap of genera, functional discrepancy between mouse and human gut microbiota is large. Lineage-specific markers underestimate the completeness of assembled genomes for uncharacterized taxa.},

abstract = {Background Shotgun metagenomics based on untargeted sequencing can explore the taxonomic profile and the function of unknown microorganisms in samples, and complement the shortage of amplicon sequencing. Binning assembled sequences into individual groups, which represent microbial genomes, is the key step and a major challenge in metagenomic research. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods have been employed in binning. Genome binning belonging to unsupervised method clusters contigs into individual genome bins by machine learning methods without the assistance of any reference databases. So far a lot of genome binning tools have emerged. Evaluating these genome tools is of great significance to microbiological research. In this study, we evaluate 15 genome binning tools containing 12 original binning tools and 3 refining binning tools by comparing the performance of these tools on chicken gut metagenomic datasets and the first CAMI challenge datasets. Results For chicken gut metagenomic datasets, original genome binner MetaBat, Groopm2 and Autometa performed better than other original binner, and MetaWrap combined the binning results of them generated the most high-quality genome bins. For CAMI datasets, Groopm2 achieved the highest purity (> 0.9) with good completeness (> 0.8), and reconstructed the most high-quality genome bins among original genome binners. Compared with Groopm2, MetaBat2 had similar performance with higher completeness and lower purity. Genome refining binners DASTool predicated the most high-quality genome bins among all genomes binners. Most genome binner performed well for unique strains. Nonetheless, reconstructing common strains still is a substantial challenge for all genome binner. Conclusions In conclusion, we tested a set of currently available, state-of-the-art metagenomics hybrid binning tools and provided a guide for selecting tools for metagenomic binning by comparing range of purity, completeness, adjusted rand index, and the number of high-quality reconstructed bins. Furthermore, available information for future binning strategy were concluded.},

Existing algorithms have achieved considerable success with simulated or real sequencing datasets. However, accurately classifying contigs from complex metagenomes is still a challenge. Results We introduced a novel clustering algorithm, MetaDecoder, which can classify metagenomic contigs based on the frequencies of k -mers and coverages. MetaDecoder was built as a two-layer model with the first layer being a GPU-based modified Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM), which controls the weight of each DPGMM cluster to avoid over-segmentation by dynamically dissolving contigs in small clusters and reassigning them to the remaining clusters. The second layer comprises a semi-supervised k -mer frequency probabilistic model and a modified Gaussian mixture model for modeling the coverage based on single copy marker genes. Benchmarks on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that MetaDecoder can be served as a promising approach for effectively clustering metagenomic contigs. Conclusions In conclusion, we developed the GPU-based MetaDecoder for effectively clustering metagenomic contigs and reconstructing microbial communities from microbial data. Applying MetaDecoder on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that it could generate more complete clusters with lower contamination. Using MetaDecoder, we identified novel high-quality genomes and expanded the existing catalog of bacterial genomes. Video Abstract},

abstract = {Signal peptide is a short peptide located in the N-terminus of proteins. It plays an important role in targeting and transferring transmembrane proteins and secreted proteins to correct positions. Compared with traditional experimental methods to identify and discover signal peptides, the computational methods are faster and more efficient, which are more practical for the analysis of thousands or even millions of protein sequences in reality, especially for the metagenomic data. Therefore, computational tools are recently proposed to classify signal peptides and predict cleavage site positions, but most of them disregard the extreme data imbalance problem in these tasks. In addition, almost all these methods rely on additional group information of proteins to boost their performances, which, however, may not always be available. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we present Unbiased Organism-agnostic Signal Peptide Network (USPNet), a signal peptide prediction and cleavage site prediction model based on deep protein language model. We propose to use label distribution-aware margin (LDAM) loss and evolutionary scale modeling (ESM) embedding to handle data imbalance and object-dependence problems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the previous methods on the classification performance. Additional study on the simulated metagenomic data further indicates that our model is a more universal and robust tool without dependency on additional group information of proteins, with the Matthews correlation coefficient improved by up to 17.5%. The proposed method will be potentially useful to discover new signal peptides from the abundant metagenomic data.},

We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth.

To improve the resolution and efficiency of metagenomic binning, BASALT (Binning Across a Series of AssembLies Toolkit), a novel binning toolkit was present in this study, which recovers, compares and optimizes metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) across a series of assemblies from short-read, long-read or hybrid strategies. BASALT incorporates self-designed algorithms which automates the separation of redundant bins, elongate and refine best bins and improve contiguity. Evaluation using mock communities revealed that BASALT auto-binning obtained up to 51% more number of MAGs with up to 10 times better MAG quality from microbial community at low (132 genomes) and medium (596 genomes) complexity, compared to other binners such as DASTool, VAMB and metaWRAP. Using BASALT, a case-study analysis of a Salt Lake sediment microbial community from northwest arid region of China was performed, resulting in 426 non-redundant MAGs, including 352 and 69 bacterial and archaeal MAGs which could not be assigned to any known species from GTDB (ANI < 95%), respectively. In addition, two Lokiarchaeotal MAGs that belong to superphylum Asgardarchaeota were observed from Salt Lake sediment samples. This is the first time that candidate species from phylum Lokiarchaeota was found in the arid and deep-inland environment, filling the current knowledge gap of earth microbiome. Overall, BASALT is proven to be a robust toolkit for metagenomic binning, and more importantly, expand the Tree of Life.},

abstract = {Microbial communities are critical to ecosystem function. A key objective of metagenomic studies is to analyse organism-specific metabolic pathways and reconstruct community interaction networks. This requires accurate assignment of assembled genome fragments to genomes. Existing binning methods often fail to reconstruct a reasonable number of genomes and report many bins of low quality and completeness. Furthermore, the performance of existing algorithms varies between samples and biotopes. Here, we present a dereplication, aggregation and scoring strategy, DAS Tool, that combines the strengths of a flexible set of established binning algorithms. DAS Tool applied to a constructed community generated more accurate bins than any automated method. Indeed, when applied to environmental and host-associated samples of different complexity, DAS Tool recovered substantially more near-complete genomes, including previously unreported lineages, than any single binning method alone. The ability to reconstruct many near-complete genomes from metagenomics data will greatly advance genome-centric analyses of ecosystems.Here the authors present a tool that enables a flexible set of existing binning algorithms to be combined, resulting in improved binning accuracy and the recovery of more near-complete genomes from metagenomes compared to standalone methods.},

abstract = {The composition of the human gut microbiota is linked to health and disease, but knowledge of individual microbial species is needed to decipher their biological roles. Despite extensive culturing and sequencing efforts, the complete bacterial repertoire of the human gut microbiota remains undefined. Here we identify 1,952 uncultured candidate bacterial species by reconstructing 92,143 metagenome-assembled genomes from 11,850 human gut microbiomes. These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature. Our work expands the known diversity of uncultured gut bacteria, which provides unprecedented resolution for taxonomic and functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota.The known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota is substantially expanded with the discovery of 1,952 uncultured bacterial species that greatly improve classification of understudied African and South American samples.},

abstract = {We have entered the multi-omics era, and we can measure cells from different aspects. When dealing with such multi-omics data, the first step is to determine the correspondence among different omics. In other words, we should match data from different spaces corresponding to the same object. This problem is particularly challenging in the single-cell multi-omics scenario because such data are very sparse with extremely high dimensions. Secondly, matched single-cell multi-omics data are rare and hard to collect. Furthermore, due to the limitations of the experimental environment, the data are usually highly noisy. To promote the single-cell multi-omics research, we overcome the above challenges, proposing a novel framework to align and integrate single-cell RNA-seq data and single-cell ATAC-seq data. Our approach can efficiently map the above data with high sparsity and noise from different spaces to a low-dimensional manifold in a unified space, making the downstream alignment and integration straightforward. Compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, our method performs better on both simulated and real single-cell data. On the real data, the performance improvement on accuracy over the previous methods is up to 55.7% regarding scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data integration. Downstream trajectory inference analysis shows that our tool can transfer the labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq with very high accuracy, which indicates our method’s effectiveness.},

abstract = {Background Obtaining high-quality (HQ) reference genomes from microbial communities is crucial for understanding the phylogeny and function of uncultured microbes in complex microbial ecosystems. Despite improvements in bioinformatic approaches to generate curated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), existing metagenome binners obtain population consensus genomes but they are nowhere comparable to genomes sequenced from isolates in terms of strain level resolution. Here, we present a framework for the integration of single-cell genomics and metagenomics, referred to as single-cell (sc) metagenomics, to reconstruct strain-resolved genomes from microbial communities at once. Results Our sc-metagenomics integration framework, termed SMAGLinker, uses single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) generated using microfluidic technology as binning guides and integrates them with metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to recover improved draft genomes. We compared sc-metagenomics with the metagenomics-alone approach using conventional metagenome binners. The sc-metagenomics approach showed precise contig binning and higher recovery rates (>97%) of rRNA and plasmids than conventional metagenomics in genome reconstruction from the cell mock community. In human microbiota samples, sc-metagenomics recovered the largest number of genomes with a total of 103 gut microbial genomes (21 HQ, with 65 showing >90% completeness) and 45 skin microbial genomes (10 HQ, with 40 showing >90% completeness), respectively. Conventional metagenomics recovered one Staphylococcus hominis genome, whereas sc-metagenomics recovered two S. hominis genomes from identical skin microbiota sample. Single-cell sequencing revealed that these S. hominis genomes were derived from two distinct strains harboring specifically different plasmids. We found that all conventional S. hominis MAGs had a substantial lack or excess of genome sequences and contamination from other Staphylococcus species ( S. epidermidis). Conclusions SMAGLinker enabled us to obtain strain-resolved genomes in the mock community and human microbiota samples by assigning metagenomic sequences correctly and covering both highly conserved genes such as rRNA genes and unique extrachromosomal elements, including plasmids. SMAGLinker will provide HQ genomes that are difficult to obtain using metagenomics alone and will facilitate the understanding of microbial ecosystems by elucidating detailed metabolic pathways and horizontal gene transfer networks.

abstract = {Drinking water contains phylogenetic diverse groups of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that affect the esthetic quality of water, water infrastructure, and public health. Taxonomic, metabolic, and ecological inferences of the drinking water microbiome depend on the accuracy, quality, and completeness of genomes that are reconstructed through the application of genome-resolved metagenomics. ABSTRACT Reconstructing microbial genomes from metagenomic short-read data can be challenging due to the unknown and uneven complexity of microbial communities. This complexity encompasses highly diverse populations, which often includes strain variants. Reconstructing high-quality genomes is a crucial part of the metagenomic workflow, as subsequent ecological and metabolic inferences depend on their accuracy, quality, and completeness. In contrast to microbial communities in other ecosystems, there has been no systematic assessment of genome-centric metagenomic workflows for drinking water microbiomes. In this study, we assessed the performance of a combination of assembly and binning strategies for time series drinking water metagenomes that were collected over 6 months. The goal of this study was to identify the combination of assembly and binning approaches that result in high-quality and -quantity metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), representing most of the sequenced metagenome. Our findings suggest that the metaSPAdes coassembly strategies had the best performance, as they resulted in larger and less fragmented assemblies, with at least 85% of the sequence data mapping to contigs greater than 1 kbp. Furthermore, a combination of metaSPAdes coassembly strategies and MetaBAT2 produced the highest number of medium-quality MAGs while capturing at least 70% of the metagenomes based on read recruitment. Utilizing different assembly/binning approaches also assists in the reconstruction of unique MAGs from closely related species that would have otherwise collapsed into a single MAG using a single workflow. Overall, our study suggests that leveraging multiple binning approaches with different metaSPAdes coassembly strategies may be required to maximize the recovery of good-quality MAGs. IMPORTANCE Drinking water contains phylogenetic diverse groups of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that affect the esthetic quality of water, water infrastructure, and public health. Taxonomic, metabolic, and ecological inferences of the drinking water microbiome depend on the accuracy, quality, and completeness of genomes that are reconstructed through the application of genome-resolved metagenomics. Using time series metagenomic data, we present reproducible genome-centric metagenomic workflows that result in high-quality and -quantity genomes, which more accurately signifies the sequenced drinking water microbiome. These genome-centric metagenomic workflows will allow for improved taxonomic and functional potential analysis that offers enhanced insights into the stability and dynamics of drinking water microbial communities.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe study of microbiomes using whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial populations that may have important roles in their environments. Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools for their evaluation and visualization.ResultsTo address these challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give investigators control over the analysis, while still being easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP’s hybrid bin extraction algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real data sets. Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance estimation, functional annotation, and visualization.ConclusionsMetaWRAP is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant improvements to the extraction and interpretation of high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.

abstract = {Culture-independent analysis with high-throughput sequencing has been widely used to characterize bacterial communities. However, signals derived from non-viable bacteria and non-cell DNA may inhibit its characterization. Here, we present a method for viable bacteria-targeted single-cell genome sequencing, called PMA-SAG-gel, to obtain comprehensive whole-genome sequences of surviving uncultured bacteria from microbial communities. PMA-SAG-gel uses gel matrixes that enable sequential enzymatic reactions for cell lysis and genome amplification of viable single cells from the microbial communities. PMA-SAG-gel removed the single-amplified genomes (SAGs) derived from dead bacteria and enabled selective sequencing of viable bacteria in the model samples of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Next, we demonstrated the recovery of near-complete SAGs of eight oxygen-tolerant bacteria, including Bacteroides spp. and Phocaeicola spp., from 1331 human feces SAGs. We found the presence of two different strains in each species and identified their specific genes to investigate the metabolic functions. The survival profile of an entire population at the strain level will provide the information for understanding the characteristics of the surviving bacteria under the specific environments or sample processing and insights for quality assessment of live bacterial products or fecal microbiota transplantation and for understanding the effect of antimicrobial treatments.},

abstract = {Abstract Metagenomic analyses of microbial communities have revealed a large degree of interspecies and intraspecies genetic diversity through the reconstruction of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Yet, metabolic modeling efforts mainly rely on reference genomes as the starting point for reconstruction and simulation of genome scale metabolic models (GEMs), neglecting the immense intra- and inter-species diversity present in microbial communities. Here, we present metaGEM (https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM), an end-to-end pipeline enabling metabolic modeling of multi-species communities directly from metagenomes. The pipeline automates all steps from the extraction of context-specific prokaryotic GEMs from MAGs to community level flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of metaGEM, we analyzed 483 samples spanning lab culture, human gut, plant-associated, soil, and ocean metagenomes, reconstructing over 14,000 GEMs. We show that GEMs reconstructed from metagenomes have fully represented metabolism comparable to isolated genomes. We demonstrate that metagenomic GEMs capture intraspecies metabolic diversity and identify potential differences in the progression of type 2 diabetes at the level of gut bacterial metabolic exchanges. Overall, metaGEM enables FBA-ready metabolic model reconstruction directly from metagenomes, provides a resource of metabolic models, and showcases community-level modeling of microbiomes associated with disease conditions allowing generation of mechanistic hypotheses.},

Accurate identification of regulatory elements is fundamental for annotating genomes and understanding gene expression patterns. While there are many attempts to develop computational promoter and enhancer identification methods, reliable tools to analyze long genomic sequences are still lacking. Prediction methods often perform poorly on the genome-wide scale because the number of negatives is much higher than that in the training sets. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic negative set updating scheme with a two-model approach, using one model for scanning the genome and the other one for testing candidate positions. The developed method achieves good genome-level performance and maintains robust performance when applied to other species, without re-training. Moreover, the unannotated predicted regulatory regions made on the human genome are enriched for disease-associated variants, suggesting them to be potentially true regulatory elements rather than false positives. We validated high scoring “false positive” predictions using reporter assay and all tested candidates were successfully validated, demonstrating the ability of our method to discover novel human regulatory regions.},

abstract = {Background Metagenome sampling bias for geographical location and lifestyle is partially responsible for the incomplete catalog of reference genomes of gut microbial species. Thus, genome assembly from currently under-represented populations may effectively expand the reference gut microbiome and improve taxonomic and functional profiling. Methods We assembled genomes using public whole-metagenomic shotgun sequencing (WMS) data for 110 and 645 fecal samples from India and Japan, respectively. In addition, we assembled genomes from newly generated WMS data for 90 fecal samples collected from Korea. Expecting genome assembly for low-abundance species may require a much deeper sequencing than that usually employed, so we performed ultra-deep WMS (> 30 Gbp or > 100 million read pairs) for the fecal samples from Korea. We consequently assembled 29,082 prokaryotic genomes from 845 fecal metagenomes for the three under-represented Asian countries and combined them with the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) to generate an expanded catalog, the Human Reference Gut Microbiome (HRGM). Results HRGM contains 232,098 non-redundant genomes for 5414 representative prokaryotic species including 780 that are novel, > 103 million unique proteins, and > 274 million single-nucleotide variants. This is an over 10% increase from the UHGG. The new 780 species were enriched for the Bacteroidaceae family, including species associated with high-fiber and seaweed-rich diets. Single-nucleotide variant density was positively associated with the speciation rate of gut commensals. We found that ultra-deep sequencing facilitated the assembly of genomes for low-abundance taxa, and deep sequencing (e.g., > 20 million read pairs) may be needed for the profiling of low-abundance taxa. Importantly, the HRGM significantly improved the taxonomic and functional classification of sequencing reads from fecal samples. Finally, analysis of human self-antigen homologs on the HRGM species genomes suggested that bacterial taxa with high cross-reactivity potential may contribute more to the pathogenesis of gut microbiome-associated diseases than those with low cross-reactivity potential by promoting inflammatory condition. Conclusions By including gut metagenomes from previously under-represented Asian countries, Korea, India, and Japan, we developed a substantially expanded microbiome catalog, HRGM. Information of the microbial genomes and coding genes is publicly available (www.mbiomenet.org/HRGM/). HRGM will facilitate the identification and functional analysis of disease-associated gut microbiota.

abstract = {We previously reported on MetaBAT, an automated metagenome binning software tool to reconstruct single genomes from microbial communities for subsequent analyses of uncultivated microbial species. MetaBAT has become one of the most popular binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity. If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering optimization to increase both computational and memory efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We therefore recommend the community adopts MetaBAT 2 for their metagenome binning experiments. MetaBAT 2 is open source software and available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat.},

abstract = {Abstract Because of the impending energy crisis and the environmental Impact of fossil fuels, researchers are actively looking for alternatives, such as Helium-3 on the Moon. Although it remains challenging to explore energies on the Moon due to the long physical distance, the lunar features, such as craters and rilles, can be the hotspots for such energy sources, according to recent studies. Thus, identifying lunar features, such as craters and rilles, can facilitate the discovery of Helium-3 on the Moon, which is enriched in such hotspots. However, previously, no computational method was developed to recognize the lunar features automatically for facilitating space energy discovery. In our research, we aim at developing the first deep learning method to identify multiple lunar features simultaneously for potential energy source discovery. Based on the state-of-the-art deep learning model, High Resolution Net, our model can efficiently extract semantic information and high-resolution spatial information from the input images, which ensures the performance for recognizing the lunar features. With a novel framework, our method can recognize multiple lunar features, such as craters and rilles, at the same time. We also used transfer learning to handle the data deficiency issue. With comprehensive experiments on three datasets, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method. All the datasets and codes are available online. The source code and the data are available at https://github.com/frankchen121212/High-Resolution-MoonNet},

abstract = {Recovering genomes from shotgun metagenomic sequence data allows detailed taxonomic and functional characterization of individual species or strains in a microbial community. Retrieving these metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) involves seven stages. First, low-quality bases, along with adapter and host sequences, are removed. Second, overlapping sequences are assembled to create longer contiguous fragments. Third, these fragments are clustered based on sequence composition and abundance. Fourth, these sequence clusters, or bins, undergo rounds of quality assessment and refinement to yield MAGs. The optional fifth stage is dereplication of MAGs to select representatives. Next, each MAG is taxonomically classified. The optional seventh stage is assessing the fraction of diversity that has been recovered. The output of this protocol is draft genomes, which can provide invaluable clues about uncultured organisms. This protocol takes ~1 week to run, depending on computational resources available, and requires prior experience with high-performance computing, shell script programming and Python.},

abstract = {Low diversity of the gut microbiome, often progressing to the point of intestinal domination by a single species, has been linked to poor outcomes in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Our ability to understand how certain organisms attain intestinal domination over others has been restricted in part by current metagenomic sequencing technologies that are typically unable to reconstruct complete genomes for individual organisms present within a sequenced microbial community. We recently developed a metagenomic read cloud sequencing and assembly approach that generates improved draft genomes for individual organisms compared to conventional short-read sequencing and assembly methods. Herein, we applied metagenomic read cloud sequencing to four stool samples collected longitudinally from an HCT patient preceding treatment and over the course of heavy antibiotic exposure. Characterization of microbiome composition by taxonomic classification of reads reveals that that upon antibiotic exposure, the subject’s gut microbiome experienced a marked decrease in diversity and became dominated by Escherichia coli. While diversity is restored at the final time point, this occurs without recovery of the original species and strain-level composition. Draft genomes for individual organisms within each sample were generated using both read cloud and conventional assembly. Read clouds were found to improve the completeness and contiguity of genome assemblies compared to conventional assembly. Moreover, read clouds enabled the placement of antibiotic resistance genes present in multiple copies both within a single draft genome and across multiple organisms. The occurrence of resistance genes associates with the timing of antibiotics administered to the patient, and comparative genomic analysis of the various intestinal E. coli strains across time points as well as the bloodstream isolate showed that the subject’s E. coli bloodstream infection likely originated from the intestine. The E. coli genome from the initial pre-transplant stool sample harbors 46 known antimicrobial resistance genes, while all other species from the pre-transplant sample each contain at most 5 genes, consistent with a model of heavy antibiotic exposure resulting in selective outgrowth of the highly antibiotic-resistant E. coli. This study demonstrates the application and utility of metagenomic read cloud sequencing and assembly to study the underlying strain-level genomic factors influencing gut microbiome dynamics under extreme selective pressures in the clinical context of HCT.},

abstract = {Advances in genome-resolved metagenomic analysis of complex microbial communities have revealed a large degree of interspecies and intraspecies genetic diversity through the reconstruction of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Yet, metabolic modeling efforts still tend to rely on reference genomes as the starting point for reconstruction and simulation of genome scale metabolic models (GEMs), neglecting the immense intra- and inter-species diversity present in microbial communities. Here we present metaGEM (https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM), an end-to-end highly scalable pipeline enabling metabolic modeling of multi-species communities directly from metagenomic samples. The pipeline automates all steps from the extraction of context-specific prokaryotic GEMs from metagenome assembled genomes to community level flux balance simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the metaGEM pipeline, we analyzed 483 samples spanning lab culture, human gut, plant associated, soil, and ocean metagenomes, to reconstruct over 14 000 prokaryotic GEMs. We show that GEMs reconstructed from metagenomes have fully represented metabolism comparable to the GEMs reconstructed from reference genomes. We further demonstrate that metagenomic GEMs capture intraspecies metabolic diversity by identifying the differences between pathogenicity levels of type 2 diabetes at the level of gut bacterial metabolic exchanges. Overall, our pipeline enables simulation-ready metabolic model reconstruction directly from individual metagenomes, provides a resource of all reconstructed metabolic models, and showcases community-level modeling of microbiomes associated with disease conditions allowing generation of mechanistic hypotheses.},

abstract = {Abstract The human gut microbiota performs functions that are essential for the maintenance of the host physiology. However, characterizing the functioning of microbial communities in relation to the host remains challenging in reference-based metagenomic analyses. Indeed, as taxonomic and functional analyses are performed independently, the link between genes and species remains unclear. Although a first set of species-level bins was built by clustering co-abundant genes, no reference bin set is established on the most used gut microbiota catalog, the Integrated Gene Catalog (IGC). With the aim to identify the best suitable method to group the IGC genes, we benchmarked nine taxonomy-independent binners implementing abundance-based, hybrid and integrative approaches. To this purpose, we designed a simulated non-redundant gene catalog (SGC) and computed adapted assessment metrics. Overall, the best trade-off between the main metrics is reached by an integrative binner. For each approach, we then compared the results of the best-performing binner with our expected community structures and applied the method to the IGC. The three approaches are distinguished by specific advantages, and by inherent or scalability limitations. Hybrid and integrative binners show promising and potentially complementary results but require improvements to be used on the IGC to recover human gut microbial species.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a powerful tool to reveal the complex biological diversity and heterogeneity among cell populations. However, the technical noise and bias of the technology still have negative impacts on the downstream analysis. Here, we present a self-supervised Contrastive LEArning framework for scRNA-seq (CLEAR) profile representation and the downstream analysis. CLEAR overcomes the heterogeneity of the experimental data with a specifically designed representation learning task and thus can handle batch effects and dropout events. In the task, the deep learning model learns to pull together the representations of similar cells while pushing apart distinct cells, without manual labeling. It achieves superior performance on a broad range of fundamental tasks, including clustering, visualization, dropout correction, batch effect removal, and pseudo-time inference. The proposed method successfully identifies and illustrates inflammatory-related mechanisms in a COVID-19 disease study with 43,695 single cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further experiments to process a million-scale single-cell dataset demonstrate the scalability of CLEAR. This scalable method generates effective scRNA-seq data representation while eliminating technical noise, and it will serve as a general computational framework for single-cell data analysis.},

MAGO offers streamlined execution of the entire metagenomics pipeline, error checking, computational resource distribution and compatibility of data formats, governed by user-tailored pipeline processing. MAGO is an open-source-software package released in three different ways, as a singularity image and a Docker container for HPC purposes as well as for running MAGO on a commodity hardware, and a virtual machine for gaining a full access to MAGO underlying structure and source code. MAGO is open to suggestions for extensions and is amenable for use in both research and teaching of genomics and molecular evolution of genomes assembled from small single-cell projects or large-scale and complex environmental metagenomes.},

abstract = {The genome sequences of many species of the human gut microbiome remain unknown, largely owing to challenges in cultivating microorganisms under laboratory conditions. Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.Draft prokaryotic genomes from faecal metagenomes of diverse human populations enrich our understanding of the human gut microbiome by identifying over two thousand new species-level taxa that have numerous disease associations.},
