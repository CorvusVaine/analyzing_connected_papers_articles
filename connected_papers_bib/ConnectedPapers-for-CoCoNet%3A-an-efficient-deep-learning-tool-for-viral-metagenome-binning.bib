abstract = {MOTIVATION
Metagenomic approaches hold the potential to characterize microbial communities and unravel the intricate link between the microbiome and biological processes. Assembly is one of the most critical steps in metagenomics experiments. It consists of transforming overlapping DNA sequencing reads into sufficiently accurate representations of the community's genomes. This process is computationally difficult and commonly results in genomes fragmented across many contigs. Computational binning methods are used to mitigate fragmentation by partitioning contigs based on their sequence composition, abundance, or chromosome organization into bins representing the community's genomes. Existing binning methods have been principally tuned for bacterial genomes and do not perform favorably on viral metagenomes.


RESULTS
We propose CoCoNet (Composition and Coverage Network), a new binning method for viral metagenomes that leverages the flexibility and the effectiveness of deep learning to model the co-occurrence of contigs belonging to the same viral genome and provide a rigorous framework for binning viral contigs. Our results show that CoCoNet substantially outperforms existing binning methods on viral datasets.

 The gut microbiome (GM) is shaped through infancy and plays a major role in determining susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases later in life. Bacteriophages (phages) are known to modulate bacterial populations in numerous ecosystems, including the gut. However, virome data is difficult to analyse because it mostly consists of unknown viruses, i.e. viral dark matter. Here, we manually resolved the viral dark matter in the largest human virome study published to date. Fecal viromes from a cohort of 647 infants at 1 year of age were deeply sequenced and analysed through successive rounds of clustering and curation. We uncovered more than ten thousand viral species distributed over 248 viral families falling within 17 viral order-level clades. Most of the defined viral families and orders were novel and belonged to the Caudoviricetes viral class. Bacterial hosts were predicted for 79% of the viral species using CRISPR spacers, including those in metagenomes from the same fecal samples. While Bacteroides-infecting Crassphages were present, novel viral families were more predominant, including phages infecting Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Phage lifestyles were determined for more than three thousand caudoviral species. Lifestyles were homogeneous at the family level for 149 Caudoviricetes families, including 32 families that were found to be virulent, while 117 were temperate. Virulent phage families were more abundant but temperate ones were more diverse and widespread. Together, the viral families found in this study represent a major expansion of existing bacteriophage taxonomy.},

abstract = {In shotgun metagenomics studies that seek to relate changes in microbial DNA across samples, processing the data on a computer often takes longer than obtaining the data from the sequencing instrument. Recently developed software packages that perform individual steps in the pipeline of data processing in principle offer speed advantages, but in practice they may contain pitfalls that prevent their use, for example, they may make approximations that introduce unacceptable errors in the data. ABSTRACT Increasing data volumes on high-throughput sequencing instruments such as the NovaSeq 6000 leads to long computational bottlenecks for common metagenomics data preprocessing tasks such as adaptor and primer trimming and host removal. Here, we test whether faster recently developed computational tools (Fastp and Minimap2) can replace widely used choices (Atropos and Bowtie2), obtaining dramatic accelerations with additional sensitivity and minimal loss of specificity for these tasks. Furthermore, the taxonomic tables resulting from downstream processing provide biologically comparable results. However, we demonstrate that for taxonomic assignment, Bowtie2’s specificity is still required. We suggest that periodic reevaluation of pipeline components, together with improvements to standardized APIs to chain them together, will greatly enhance the efficiency of common bioinformatics tasks while also facilitating incorporation of further optimized steps running on GPUs, FPGAs, or other architectures. We also note that a detailed exploration of available algorithms and pipeline components is an important step that should be taken before optimization of less efficient algorithms on advanced or nonstandard hardware. IMPORTANCE In shotgun metagenomics studies that seek to relate changes in microbial DNA across samples, processing the data on a computer often takes longer than obtaining the data from the sequencing instrument. Recently developed software packages that perform individual steps in the pipeline of data processing in principle offer speed advantages, but in practice they may contain pitfalls that prevent their use, for example, they may make approximations that introduce unacceptable errors in the data. Here, we show that differences in choices of these components can speed up overall data processing by 5-fold or more on the same hardware while maintaining a high degree of correctness, greatly reducing the time taken to interpret results. This is an important step for using the data in clinical settings, where the time taken to obtain the results may be critical for guiding treatment.},

abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for contig binning only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species). In this paper, we introduce GraphBin2 which refines the binning results obtained from existing tools and, more importantly, is able to assign contigs to multiple bins. GraphBin2 uses the connectivity and coverage information from assembly graphs to adjust existing binning results on contigs and to infer contigs shared by multiple species. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that GraphBin2 not only improves binning results of existing tools but also supports to assign contigs to multiple bins. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Applied computing → Bioinformatics; Applied computing → Computational genomics},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
The field of metagenomics has provided valuable insights into the structure, diversity and ecology within microbial communities. One key step in metagenomics analysis is to assemble reads into longer contigs which are then binned into groups of contigs that belong to different species present in the metagenomic sample. Binning of contigs plays an important role in metagenomics and most available binning algorithms bin contigs using genomic features such as oligonucleotide/k-mer composition and contig coverage. As metagenomic contigs are derived from the assembly process, they are output from the underlying assembly graph which contains valuable connectivity information between contigs that can be used for binning.


RESULTS
We propose GraphBin, a new binning method that makes use of the assembly graph and applies a label propagation algorithm to refine the binning result of existing tools.We show that GraphBin can make use of the assembly graphs constructed from both the de Bruijn graph and the overlap-layout-consensus approach. Moreover, we demonstrate improved experimental results from GraphBin in terms of identifying mis-binned contigs and binning of contigs discarded by existing binning tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the information from the assembly graph has been used in a tool for the binning of metagenomic contigs.

abstract = {Background A pangenome is the collection of all genes found in a set of related genomes. For microbes, these genomes are often different strains of the same species, and the pangenome offers a means to compare gene content variation with differences in phenotypes, ecology, and phylogenetic relatedness. Though most frequently applied to bacteria, there is growing interest in adapting pangenome analysis to bacteriophages. However, working with phage genomes presents new challenges. First, most phage families are under-sampled, and homologous genes in related viruses can be difficult to identify. Second, homing endonucleases and intron-like sequences may be present, resulting in fragmented gene calls. Each of these issues can reduce the accuracy of standard pangenome analysis tools. Methods We developed an R pipeline called Rephine.r that takes as input the gene clusters produced by an initial pangenomics workflow. Rephine.r then proceeds in two primary steps. First, it identifies three common causes of fragmented gene calls: 1) indels creating early stop codons and new start codons; 2) interruption by a selfish genetic element; and 3) splitting at the ends of the reported genome. Fragmented genes are then fused to create new sequence alignments. In tandem, Rephine.r searches for distant homologs separated into different gene families using Hidden Markov Models. Significant hits are used to merge families into larger clusters. A final round of fragment identification is then run, and results may be used to infer single-copy core genomes and phylogenetic trees. Results We applied Rephine.r to three well-studied phage groups: the Tevenvirinae (e.g. T4), the Studiervirinae (e.g. T7), and the Pbunaviruses (e.g. PB1). In each case, Rephine.r recovered additional members of the single-copy core genome and increased the overall bootstrap support of the phylogeny. The Rephine.r pipeline is provided through GitHub (https://www.github.com/coevoeco/Rephine.r) as a single script for automated analysis and with utility functions and a walkthrough for researchers with specific use cases for each type of correction.},

While microbial organosulfur metabolism is well-studied, the role of viruses in organosulfur metabolism is unknown. Here we report the discovery of 39 gene families involved in organosulfur metabolism encoded by 3,749 viruses from diverse ecosystems, including human microbiomes. The viruses infect organisms from all three domains of life. Six gene families encode for enzymes that degrade organosulfur compounds into sulfide, while others manipulate organosulfur compounds and may influence sulfide production. We show that viral metabolic genes encode key enzymatic domains, are translated into protein, are maintained after recombination, and that sulfide provides a fitness advantage to viruses. Our results reveal viruses as drivers of organosulfur metabolism with important implications for human and environmental health.},

abstract = {Background Viruses are a significant player in many biosphere and human ecosystems, but most signals remain “hidden” in metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequence datasets due to the lack of universal gene markers, database representatives, and insufficiently advanced identification tools. Results Here, we introduce VirSorter2, a DNA and RNA virus identification tool that leverages genome-informed database advances across a collection of customized automatic classifiers to improve the accuracy and range of virus sequence detection. When benchmarked against genomes from both isolated and uncultivated viruses, VirSorter2 uniquely performed consistently with high accuracy (F1-score > 0.8) across viral diversity, while all other tools under-detected viruses outside of the group most represented in reference databases (i.e., those in the order Caudovirales ). Among the tools evaluated, VirSorter2 was also uniquely able to minimize errors associated with atypical cellular sequences including eukaryotic genomes and plasmids. Finally, as the virosphere exploration unravels novel viral sequences, VirSorter2’s modular design makes it inherently able to expand to new types of viruses via the design of new classifiers to maintain maximal sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion With multi-classifier and modular design, VirSorter2 demonstrates higher overall accuracy across major viral groups and will advance our knowledge of virus evolution, diversity, and virus-microbe interaction in various ecosystems.

abstract = {The human intestinal microbiota is abundant in viruses, comprising mainly bacteriophages, occasionally outnumbering bacteria 10:1 and is termed the virome. Due to their high genetic diversity and the lack of suitable tools and reference databases, the virome remains poorly characterised and is often referred to as “viral dark matter”. However, the choice of sequencing platforms, read lengths and library preparation make study design challenging with respect to the virome. Here we have compared the use of PCR and PCR-free methods for sequence-library construction on the Illumina sequencing platform for characterising the human faecal virome. Viral DNA was extracted from faecal samples of three healthy donors and sequenced. Our analysis shows that most variation was reflecting the individually specific faecal virome. However, we observed differences between PCR and PCR-free library preparation that affected the recovery of low-abundance viral genomes. Using three faecal samples in this study, the PCR library preparation samples led to a loss of lower-abundance vOTUs evident in their PCR-free pairs (vOTUs 128, 6202 and 8364) and decreased the alpha-diversity indices (Chao1 p-value = 0.045 and Simpson p-value = 0.044). Thus, differences between PCR and PCR-free methods are important to consider when investigating “rare” members of the gut virome, with these biases likely negligible when investigating moderately and highly abundant viruses.},

Binning assembled sequences into individual groups, which represent microbial genomes, is the key step and a major challenge in metagenomic research. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods have been employed in binning. Genome binning belonging to unsupervised method clusters contigs into individual genome bins by machine learning methods without the assistance of any reference databases. So far a lot of genome binning tools have emerged. Evaluating these genome tools is of great significance to microbiological research. In this study, we evaluate 15 genome binning tools containing 12 original binning tools and 3 refining binning tools by comparing the performance of these tools on chicken gut metagenomic datasets and the first CAMI challenge datasets. Results For chicken gut metagenomic datasets, original genome binner MetaBat, Groopm2 and Autometa performed better than other original binner, and MetaWrap combined the binning results of them generated the most high-quality genome bins. For CAMI datasets, Groopm2 achieved the highest purity (> 0.9) with good completeness (> 0.8), and reconstructed the most high-quality genome bins among original genome binners. Compared with Groopm2, MetaBat2 had similar performance with higher completeness and lower purity.

abstract = {Viruses are some of the most abundant biological entities on Earth, and prokaryote virus are the dominant members of the viral community. Because of the diversity of prokaryote virus, functional annotation cannot be performed on a large number of genes from newly discovered prokaryote virus by searching the current database; therefore, the development of an alignment-free algorithm for functional annotation of prokaryote virus proteins is important to understand the viral community. The identification of prokaryote virus proteins (PVVPs) is a critical step for many viral analyses, such as species classification, phylogenetic analysis and the exploration of how prokaryote virus interact with their hosts. Although a series of PVVP prediction tools have been developed, the performance of these tools is still not satisfactory. Moreover, viral metagenomic data contains fragmented sequences, leading to the existence of some incomplete genes. Therefore, a tool that can identify partial prokaryote virus proteins is also needed. In this work, we present a novel algorithm, called VirionFinder, to identify the complete and partial PVVPs from non-prokaryote virus virion proteins (non-PVVPs). VirionFinder uses the sequence and biochemical properties of 20 amino acids as the mathematical model to encode the protein sequences and uses a deep learning technique to identify whether a given protein is a PVVP. Compared with the state-of-the-art tools using artificial benchmark datasets, the results show that under the same specificity (Sp), the sensitivity (Sn) of VirionFinder is approximately 10–34% much higher than the Sn of these tools on both complete and partial proteins. When evaluating related tools using real virome data, the recognition rate of PVVP-like sequences of VirionFinder is also much higher than that of the other tools. We expect that VirionFinder will be a powerful tool for identifying novel virion proteins from both complete prokaryote virus genomes and viral metagenomic data.

abstract = {Background Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entity on the planet, and are key components of any ecosystem they are present in. The gut virome is increasingly being implicated in disease states although these studies largely focus on lytic phages in adults. Here we identify prophages from a large infant cohort and investigate their potential functions. Results We identified 10645 vOTUs from 662 metagenomes. No core virome was found: the most prevalent vOTU was identified in 70% of the samples. The most abundant and prevalent group of phages are a novel group closely related to Bacteroides phage Hanky p00’. Functional annotation of this group revealed the presence of genes in the dDTP-L-rhamnose pathway, possibly involved in the production of capsular polysaccharides. We also found an abundance of diversity generating retroelements in the phages. Additionally, paired virome data allowed us to show that the majority of prophages are induced in at least one sample and that this is not affected by the use of antibiotics in the 4 weeks prior to sampling. Conclusions Prophages in the infant gut are largely unique to the individual and not shared. Most of them appear to be induced and so may be key drivers in shaping the bacterial microbiome. The most abundant group of phages are novel, and possess elements that may allow them to maintain differentially susceptible subpopulations of their host bacterium; whilst also containing diversity generating retroelements that could expand their host range. Prophages are important components of the infant gut that may have far reaching influences on the composition and function of the microbiome.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Although the set of currently known viruses has been steadily expanding, only a tiny fraction of the Earth's virome has been sequenced so far. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing provides an opportunity to reveal novel viruses but faces the computational challenge of identifying viral genomes that are often difficult to detect in metagenomic assemblies.


RESULTS
We describe a metaviralSPAdes tool for identifying viral genomes in metagenomic assembly graphs that is based on analyzing variations in the coverage depth between viruses and bacterial chromosomes. We benchmarked metaviralSPAdes on diverse metagenomic datasets, verified our predictions using a set of virus-specific Hidden Markov Models, and demonstrated that it improves on the state-of-the-art viral identification pipelines.

abstract = {The human skin microbiome is a key player in human health, with diverse functions ranging from defense against pathogens to education of the immune system. While recent studies have begun to shed light on the valuable role that skin microorganisms have in maintaining a healthy skin barrier, a detailed understanding of the complex interactions that shape healthy skin microbial communities is limited. Cobamides, the vitamin B12 class of cofactor, are essential for organisms across the tree of life. Because this vitamin is only produced by a limited fraction of prokaryotes, cobamide sharing has been shown to mediate community dynamics within microbial communities. Here, we provide the first large-scale unbiased metagenomic assessment of cobamide biosynthesis and utilization in the skin microbiome. We show that while numerous and diverse taxa across the major bacterial phyla on the skin are cobamide dependent, relatively few species encode for de novo cobamide biosynthesis. We find that cobamide sharing shapes the network structure in microbial communities across the different microenvironments of the skin and that changes in community structure and microbiome diversity are driven by the abundance of cobamide producers in the Corynebacterium genus, in both healthy and disease skin states. Lastly, we find that de novo cobamide biosynthesis is enriched only in host-associated Corynebacterium species, including those prevalent on human skin. We confirm that the cofactor is produced in excess through quantification of cobamide production by skin-associated species isolated in the laboratory. Taken together, our results support a role for cobamide sharing within skin microbial communities, which we predict stabilizes the microbiome and mediates host interactions.},

 In this study we report the first comprehensive metagenomic analysis of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic virome occupying luminal and mucosa-associated habitats along the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in two animal species, the domestic pig and rhesus macaque.
The highest loads and diversity of bacteriophages are found in the lumen of the large intestine in both mammals. Mucosal samples contain much lower viral loads but a higher proportion of eukaryotic viruses. Parenchymal organs contained significant amounts of bacteriophages of gut origin, in addition to some eukaryotic viruses.
GIT virome composition is both region- and species-specific with a strong separation between upper and lower gut. Nonetheless, certain viral and phage species are found ubiquitously from the oral cavity to the distal colon. Correlations between individual phages and their potential microbial hosts in the GIT are overwhelmingly positive, which confirms earlier concepts of the temperate-like life cycles of the majority of gut phages and a prevalence of the “piggyback-the-winner” ecological dynamics.},

abstract = {Motivation Due to the complexity of metagenomic community, de novo assembly on next generation sequencing data is commonly unable to produce microbial complete genomes. Metagenomic binning is a crucial task that could group the fragmented contigs into clusters based on their nucleotide compositions and read depths. These features work well on the long contigs, but are not stable for the short ones. Assembly and paired-end graphs can provide the connectedness between contigs, where the linked contigs have high chance to be derived from the same clusters. Results We developed METAMVGL, a multi-view graph-based metagenomic contig binning algorithm by integrating both assembly and paired-end graphs. It could strikingly rescue the short contigs and correct the binning errors from dead ends subgraphs. METAMVGL could learn the graphs’ weights automatically and predict the contig labels in a uniform multi-view label propagation framework. In the experiments, we observed METAMVGL significantly increased the high-confident edges in the combined graph and linked dead ends to the main graph. It also outperformed with many state-of-the-art binning methods, MaxBin2, MetaBAT2, MyCC, CONCOCT, SolidBin and Graphbin on the metagenomic sequencing from simulation, two mock communities and real Sharon data.

Metagenome-Assembled Genomes Orchestra (MAGO) is a computational framework that integrates and simplifies metagenome assembly, binning, bin improvement, bin quality (completeness and contamination), bin annotation, and evolutionary placement of bins via detailed maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on multiple marker genes using different amino acid substitution models, next to average nucleotide identity analysis of genomes for delineation of species boundaries and operational taxonomic units. MAGO offers streamlined execution of the entire metagenomics pipeline, error checking, computational resource distribution and compatibility of data formats, governed by user-tailored pipeline processing. MAGO is an open-source-software package released in three different ways, as a singularity image and a Docker container for HPC purposes as well as for running MAGO on a commodity hardware, and a virtual machine for gaining a full access to MAGO underlying structure and source code.

abstract = {Microbes play fundamental roles in shaping natural ecosystem properties and functions, but do so under constraints imposed by their viral predators. However, studying viruses in nature can be challenging due to low biomass and the lack of universal gene markers. Though metagenomic short-read sequencing has greatly improved our virus ecology toolkit— and revealed many critical ecosystem roles for viruses — microdiverse populations and fine-scale genomic traits are missed. Some of these microdiverse populations are abundant and the missed regions may be of interest for identifying selection pressures that underpin evolutionary constraints associated with hosts and environments. Though long-read sequencing promises complete virus genomes on single reads, it currently suffers from high DNA requirements and sequencing errors that limit accurate gene prediction. Here we introduce VirION2, an integrated short- and long-read metagenomic wet-lab and informatics pipeline that updates our previous method (VirION) to further enhance the utility of long-read viral metagenomics. Using a viral mock community, we first optimized laboratory protocols (polymerase choice, DNA shearing size, PCR cycling) to enable 76% longer reads (now median length of 6,965 bp) from 100-fold less input DNA (now 1 nanogram). Using a virome from a natural seawater sample, we compared viromes generated with VirION2 against other library preparation options (unamplified, original VirION, and short-read), and optimized downstream informatics for improved long-read error correction and assembly. VirION2 assemblies combined with short-read based data (‘enhanced’viromes), provided significant improvements over VirION libraries in the recovery of longer and more complete viral genomes, and our optimized error-correction strategy using long- and short-read data achieved 99.97% accuracy. In the seawater virome, VirION2 assemblies captured 5,161 viral populations (including all of the virus populations observed in the other assemblies), 30% of which were uniquely assembled through inclusion of long-reads, and 22% of the top 10% most abundant virus populations derived from assembly of long-reads. Viral populations unique to VirION2 assemblies had significantly higher microdiversity, which may explain why short-read virome approaches failed to capture them. These findings suggest the VirION2 sample prep and workflow (updated at protocols.io) can help researchers better investigate the virosphere, even from challenging low-biomass samples. Our new protocols are available to the research community on protocols.io as a ‘living document’ to facilitate dissemination of updates to keep pace with the rapid evolution of long read sequencing technology. Taken together, the addition of long-reads uniquely enabled the recovery of 22% of the most abundant viruses—that would have been missed in short-read only assemblies.},

abstract = {Background Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study the structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for binning contigs only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species). Results In this paper, we introduce GraphBin2 which refines the binning results obtained from existing tools and, more importantly, is able to assign contigs to multiple bins. GraphBin2 uses the connectivity and coverage information from assembly graphs to adjust existing binning results on contigs and to infer contigs shared by multiple species. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that GraphBin2 not only improves binning results of existing tools but also supports to assign contigs to multiple bins. Conclusion GraphBin2 incorporates the coverage information into the assembly graph to refine the binning results obtained from existing binning tools.

abstract = {Background The genomic sequences of mycobacteriophages, phages infecting mycobacterial hosts, are diverse and mosaic. Mycobacteriophages often share little nucleotide similarity, but most of them have been grouped into lettered clusters and further into subclusters. Traditionally, mycobacteriophage genomes are analyzed based on sequence alignment or knowledge of gene content. However, these approaches are computationally expensive and can be ineffective for significantly diverged sequences. As an alternative to alignment-based genome analysis, we evaluated tetranucleotide usage in mycobacteriophage genomes. These methods make it easier to characterize features of the mycobacteriophage population at many scales. Description We computed tetranucleotide usage deviation (TUD), the ratio of observed counts of 4-mers in a genome to the expected count under a null model. TUD values are comparable between members of a phage subcluster and distinct between subclusters. With few exceptions, neighbor joining phylogenetic trees and hierarchical clustering dendrograms constructed using TUD values place phages in a monophyletic clade with members of the same subcluster. Regions in a genome with exceptional TUD values can point to interesting features of genomic architecture. Finally, we found that subcluster B3 mycobacteriophages contain significantly overrepresented 4-mers and 6-mers that are atypical of phage genomes. Conclusions Statistics based on tetranucleotide usage support established clustering of mycobacteriophages and can uncover interesting relationships within and between sequenced phage genomes. These methods are efficient to compute and do not require sequence alignment or knowledge of gene content.

There is significant interest in altering the course of cardiometabolic disease development via gut microbiomes. Nevertheless, the highly abundant phage members of the complex gut ecosystem -which impact gut bacteria- remain understudied. Here, we show gut virome changes associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), a highly prevalent clinical condition preceding cardiometabolic disease, in 196 participants by combined sequencing of bulk whole genome and virus like particle communities. MetS gut viromes exhibit decreased richness and diversity. They are enriched in phages infecting Streptococcaceae and Bacteroidaceae and depleted in those infecting Bifidobacteriaceae. Differential abundance analysis identifies eighteen viral clusters (VCs) as significantly associated with either MetS or healthy viromes. Among these are a MetS-associated Roseburia VC that is related to healthy control-associated Faecalibacterium and Oscillibacter VCs. Further analysis of these VCs revealed the Candidatus Heliusviridae, a highly widespread gut phage lineage found in 90+% of participants. The identification of the temperate Ca. Heliusviridae provides a starting point to studies of phage effects on gut bacteria and the role that this plays in MetS.},

abstract = {Through generation of the DEVoC, we added numerous previously uncharacterized viral genomes and genes to the ever-increasing worldwide pool of human gut viromes. The DEVoC, the largest human gut virome catalog generated from consistently processed fecal samples, facilitated the analysis of the 91 healthy Danish gut viromes. ABSTRACT Gut viruses are important, yet often neglected, players in the complex human gut microbial ecosystem. Recently, the number of human gut virome studies has been increasing; however, we are still only scratching the surface of the immense viral diversity. In this study, 254 virus-enriched fecal metagenomes from 204 Danish subjects were used to generate the Danish Enteric Virome Catalog (DEVoC) containing 12,986 nonredundant viral scaffolds, of which the majority was previously undescribed, encoding 190,029 viral genes. The DEVoC was used to compare 91 healthy DEVoC gut viromes from children, adolescents, and adults that were used to create the DEVoC. Gut viromes of healthy Danish subjects were dominated by phages. While most phage genomes (PGs) only occurred in a single subject, indicating large virome individuality, 39 PGs were present in more than 10 healthy subjects. Among these 39 PGs, the prevalences of three PGs were associated with age. To further study the prevalence of these 39 prevalent PGs, 1,880 gut virome data sets of 27 studies from across the world were screened, revealing several age-, geography-, and disease-related prevalence patterns. Two PGs also showed a remarkably high prevalence worldwide—a crAss-like phage (20.6% prevalence), belonging to the tentative AlphacrAssvirinae subfamily, and a previously undescribed circular temperate phage infecting Bacteroides dorei (14.4% prevalence), called LoVEphage because it encodes lots of viral elements. Due to the LoVEphage’s high prevalence and novelty, public data sets in which the LoVEphage was detected were de novo assembled, resulting in an additional 18 circular LoVEphage-like genomes (67.9 to 72.4 kb). IMPORTANCE Through generation of the DEVoC, we added numerous previously uncharacterized viral genomes and genes to the ever-increasing worldwide pool of human gut viromes. The DEVoC, the largest human gut virome catalog generated from consistently processed fecal samples, facilitated the analysis of the 91 healthy Danish gut viromes. Characterizing the biggest cohort of healthy gut viromes from children, adolescents, and adults to date confirmed the previously established high interindividual variation in human gut viromes and demonstrated that the effect of age on the gut virome composition was limited to the prevalence of specific phage (groups). The identification of a previously undescribed prevalent phage illustrates the usefulness of developing virome catalogs, and we foresee that the DEVoC will benefit future analysis of the roles of gut viruses in human health and disease.},

abstract = {The gut microbiome (GM) is shaped through infancy and plays a major role in determining susceptibility to chronic diseases later in life. Bacteriophages (phage) are known to modulate bacterial populations in numerous ecosystems, including the gut. However, virome data is difficult to analyse because it mostly consists of unknown viruses, i.e. viral dark matter. Here, we manually resolved the viral dark matter in the largest human virome study published to date. Fecal viromes from a cohort of 647 infants at 1 year of age were deeply sequenced and analysed through successive rounds of clustering and curation. This uncovered more than ten thousand viral species distributed over 248 viral families falling within 17 viral order-level clusters. Most of the defined viral families and orders were novel and belonged to the Caudoviricetes viral class. Bacterial hosts were predicted for 79% of the viral species using CRISPR spacers in metagenomes from the same fecal samples. While Bacteroides-infecting Crassphages were present, novel viral families were more predominant, including phages infecting Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Phage lifestyles were determined for more than three thousand caudoviral species. Lifestyles were homogeneous at the family level for 149 caudiviral families. 32 families were found to be virulent, while 117 families were temperate. Virulent phage families were more abundant but temperate phage families were more diverse and widespread. Together, the viral families found in this study represent a major expansion of current bacteriophage taxonomy, and the sequences have been put online for use and validation by the community.},

abstract = {Bacteriophages are the most numerous entities on Earth. The number of sequenced phage genomes is approximately 8000 and increasing rapidly. Sequencing of a genome is followed by annotation, where genes, start codons, and functions are putatively identified. The mainstays of phage genome annotation are auto-annotation programs such as Glimmer and GeneMark. Due to the relatively small size of phage genomes, many groups choose to manually curate auto-annotation results to increase accuracy. An additional benefit of manual curation of auto-annotated phage genomes is that the process is amenable to be performed by students, and has been shown to improve student recruitment to the sciences. However, despite its greater accuracy and pedagogical value, manual curation suffers from high labor cost, lack of standardization and a degree of subjectivity in decision making, and susceptibility to mistakes. Here, we present a method developed in our lab that is designed to produce accurate annotations while reducing subjectivity and providing a degree of standardization in decision-making. We show that our method produces genome annotations more accurate than auto-annotation programs while retaining the pedagogical benefits of manual genome curation.},

 Background: Bacteriophage (phage) is the most abundant and diverse biological entity on the Earth. This makes it a challenge to identify and annotate phage genomes efficiently on a large scale. Portal (portal protein), TerL (large terminase subunit protein) and TerS (small terminase subunit protein) are the three specific proteins of the tailed phage. Here, we develop a CNN (convolutional neural network)-based framework, DeephageTP, to identify these three proteins from metagenome data. The framework takes one-hot encoding data of the original protein sequences as the input and extracts the predictive features in the process of modeling. The cutoff loss value for each protein category was determined by exploiting the distributions of the loss values of the sequences within the same category. Finally, we tested the efficacy of the framework using three real metagenomic datasets. Result: The proposed multiclass classification CNN-based model was trained by the training datasets and shows relatively high prediction performance ( A ccuracy : Portal, 98.8%; TerL, 98.6%; TerS, 97.8%) for the three protein categories, respectively. The experiments using the independent mimic dataset demonstrate that the performance of the model could become worse along with the increase of the data size. To address this issue, we determined and set the cutoff loss values (i.e., TerL: -5.2, Portal: -4.2, TerS: -2.9) for each of the three categories, respectively. With these values, the model obtains high performance in terms of Precision in identifying the TerL and Portal sequences (i.e, ~ 94% and ~ 90%, respectively) from the mimic dataset that is 20 times larger than the training dataset. More interestingly, the framework identified from the three real metagenomic datasets many novel phage sequences that are not detectable by the two alignment-based methods (i.e., DIAMOND and HMMER). Conclusion: Compared to the conventional alignment-based methods, our proposed framework shows high performance in identifying phage-specific protein sequences with a particular advantage in identifying the novel protein sequences with remote homology to their known counterparts in public databases. Indeed, our method could also be applied for identifying the other protein sequences with the characteristic of high complexity and low conservation.

abstract = {The human skin microbiome is a key player in human health, with diverse functions ranging from defense against pathogens to education of the immune system. Recent studies have begun unraveling the complex interactions within skin microbial communities, shedding light on the invaluable role that skin microorganisms have in maintaining a healthy skin barrier. While theCorynebacteriumgenus is a dominant taxon of the skin microbiome, relatively little is known how skin-associated Corynebacteria contribute to microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions on the skin. Here, we performed a comparative genomics analysis of 71Corynebacteriumspecies from diverse ecosystems, which revealed functional differences between host- and environment-associated species. In particular, host-associated species were enriched forde novobiosynthesis of cobamides, which are a class of cofactor essential for metabolism in organisms across the tree of life but are produced by a limited number of prokaryotes. Because cobamides have been hypothesized to mediate community dynamics within microbial communities, we analyzed skin metagenomes forCorynebacteriumcobamide producers, which revealed a positive correlation between cobamide producer abundance and microbiome diversity, a trait associated with skin health. We also provide the first metagenome-based assessment of cobamide biosynthesis and utilization in the skin microbiome, showing that both dominant and low abundant skin taxa encode for thede novobiosynthesis pathway and that cobamide-dependent enzymes are encoded by phylogenetically diverse taxa across the major bacterial phyla on the skin. Taken together, our results support a role for cobamide sharing within skin microbial communities, which we hypothesize mediates community dynamics.},

We present the metaplasmidSPAdes tool for plasmid assembly in metagenomic data sets that reduced the false positive rate of plasmid detection compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. We assembled plasmids in diverse data sets and have shown that thousands of plasmids remained below the radar in already completed genomic and metagenomic studies. Our analysis revealed the extreme variability of plasmids and has led to the discovery of many novel plasmids (including many plasmids carrying antibiotic-resistance genes) without significant similarities to currently known ones.},
