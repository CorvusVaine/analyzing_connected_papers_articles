Here, we derive microbiome-level properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxon co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies.

abstract = {Motivation Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem, which affects millions of people worldwide, and if left unchecked is expected to upend many aspects of healthcare as it is practiced today. Identifying the type of antibiotic resistant genes in genome and metagenomic sample is of utmost importance in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infections. Today there are multiple tools available that predict antibiotic resistance class from DNA and protein sequences, yet there is a lack of benchmarks on the performances of these tools. Results We have developed a dataset that is curated from 15 available databases, and annotated with their antibiotic class labels. We also developed a transfer learning approach with neural networks, TRAC, that outperforms existing antiobiotic resistance prediction tools. While TRAC provides the current state-of-the-art performance, we hope our newly developed dataset will also provide the community with a much needed standardized dataset to develop novel methods that can predict antibiotic resistance class with superior prediction performance. Availability TRAC is available at github (https://github.com/nafizh/TRAC) and the datasets are available at figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11413302).

abstract = {Large-scale microbiome studies investigating disease-inducing microbial roles base their findings on differences between microbial count data in contrasting environments (e.g., stool samples between cases and controls). These microbiome survey studies are often impeded by small sample sizes and database bias. Combining data from multiple survey studies often results in obvious batch effects, even when DNA preparation and sequencing methods are identical. Relatedly, predictive models trained on one microbial DNA dataset often do not generalize to outside datasets. In this study, we address these limitations by applying word embedding algorithms (GloVe) and PCA transformation to ASV data from the American Gut Project and generating translation matrices that can be applied to any 16S rRNA V4 region gut microbiome sequencing study. Because these approaches contextualize microbial occurrences in a larger dataset while reducing dimensionality of the feature space, they can improve generalization of predictive models that predict host phenotype from stool associated gut microbiota. The GMEmbeddings R package contains GloVe and PCA embedding transformation matrices at 50, 100 and 250 dimensions, each learned using ∼15,000 samples from the American Gut Project. It currently supports the alignment, matching, and matrix multiplication to allow users to transform their V4 16S rRNA data into these embedding spaces. We show how to correlate the properties in the new embedding space to KEGG functional pathways for biological interpretation of results. Lastly, we provide benchmarking on six gut microbiome datasets describing three phenotypes to demonstrate the ability of embedding-based microbiome classifiers to generalize to independent datasets. Future iterations of GMEmbeddings will include embedding transformation matrices for other biological systems. Available at: https://github.com/MaudeDavidLab/GMEmbeddings.},

This discrepancy decreases the power of studies to identify meaningful differences between samples, increases the likelihood of false positive results, and subsequently limits reproducibility. Despite the vast collections of microbiome data already available, biome-specific patterns of microbial structure are not currently leveraged to inform studies. Instead, most microbiome survey studies focus on differential abundance testing per taxa in pursuit of specific biomarkers for a given phenotype. This methodology assumes differences in individual species, genera, or families can be used to distinguish between microbial communities and ignores community-level response. In this paper, we propose to leverage public microbiome databases to shift the analysis paradigm from a focus on taxonomic counts to a focus on comprehensive properties that more completely characterize microbial community members’ function and environmental relationships. We learn these properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxa co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. The resulting set of embeddings transforms human gut microbiome data from thousands of taxa counts to a latent variable landscape of only one hundred “properties”, or contextual relationships. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that these properties can be interpreted in the context of current knowledge; properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways, and distances between taxa in “property space” roughly correlate with their phylogenetic distances. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies. More broadly, this paper explores a reframing of the microbiome analysis mindset, from taxonomic counts to comprehensive community-level properties. By providing a set of pre-trained embeddings, we allow any V4 16S amplicon study to leverage and apply the publicly informed properties presented to increase the statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of analysis.},

abstract = {Intestinal microbiome, comprising the whole microbiota, their genes and genomes living in the human gut have significant roles in promoting health or disease status. As many studies showed so far, identifying the bacterial components of the microbiome can reveal important biomarkers to help in the disease comprehension to a further adequate treatment. However, the human nature is quite variable considering the genetic components associated with life styles, directly reflecting on the gut microbiome. Thus, it is extremely important to know the populational microbiome background in order to draw conclusions regarding the health and disease conditions. Also, methodological best practices and knowledge about the methods being used are essential for the results quality and applicability with clinical relevance. In this way, we standardized the sample collection and processing methods used for the Probiome assay, a test developed to identify the Brazilian bacteriome from stool samples. Neotools Metabarcode pipeline of analysis was developed to obtain the best result from the samples. This pipeline uses the information of amplicon single variants (ASVs) in 100% identical oligotype clusters, and performs a de novo taxonomical assignment based on similarity for unknown sequences. To better comprehend the results obtained in Probiome assays, is essential to know the intestinal bacteriome diversity of Brazilians. Thus, we applied the standardized methods herein developed and began characterizing our populational data to allow a better understanding of the Brazilian bacteriome profiles and how they can be related to other microbiome studies.},

abstract = {Using a sample from a population to estimate the proportion of the population with a certain category label is a broadly important problem. In the context of microbiome studies, this problem arises when researchers wish to use a sample from a population of microbes to estimate the population proportion of a particular taxon, known as the taxon's relative abundance. In this paper, we propose a beta-binomial model for this task. Like existing models, our model allows for a taxon's relative abundance to be associated with covariates of interest. However, unlike existing models, our proposal also allows for the overdispersion in the taxon's counts to be associated with covariates of interest. We exploit this model in order to propose tests not only for differential relative abundance, but also for differential variability. The latter is particularly valuable in light of speculation that dysbiosis, the perturbation from a normal microbiome that can occur in certain disease conditions, may manifest as a loss of stability, or increase in variability, of the counts associated with each taxon. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed model using a simulation study and an application to soil microbial data.},

Historically treated as a purely ecological process, range expansion is now understood to involve eco-evolutionary feedbacks due to spatial genetic structure that emerges as populations spread. We synthesize empirical and theoretical work on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of range expansion, with emphasis on bridging directional, deterministic processes that favor evolved increases in dispersal and demographic traits with stochastic processes that lead to the random fixation of alleles and traits. We develop a framework for understanding the joint influence of these processes in changing the mean and variance of expansion speed and its underlying traits. Our synthesis of recent laboratory experiments supports the consistent role of evolution in accelerating expansion speed on average, and highlights unexpected diversity in how evolution can influence variability in speed-results not well predicted by current theory. We discuss and evaluate support for three classes of modifiers of eco-evolutionary range dynamics (landscape context, trait genetics, and biotic interactions), identify emerging themes, and suggest new directions for future work in a field that stands to increase in relevance as populations move in response to global change.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical work suggested that deleterious mutations could accumulate during the range expansion of a species, negatively affecting its fitness. Recent theory predicts that the fitness of pioneer populations can decline when species expand their range, due to high rates of genetic drift on wave fronts making selection less efficient at purging deleterious variants. To test these predictions, we studied the fate of mutator bacteria expanding their range for 1650 generations on agar plates. In agreement with theory, we find that growth abilities of strains with a high mutation rate (HMR lines) decreased significantly over time, unlike strains with a lower mutation rate (LMR lines) that present three to four times fewer mutations. Estimation of the distribution of fitness effect under a spatially explicit model reveals a mean negative effect for new mutations (−0.38%), but it suggests that both advantageous and deleterious mutations have accumulated during the experiment. Furthermore, the fitness of HMR lines measured in different environments has decreased relative to the ancestor strain, whereas that of LMR lines remained unchanged. Contrastingly, strains with a HMR evolving in a well-mixed environment accumulated less mutations than agar-evolved strains and showed an increased fitness relative to the ancestor. Our results suggest that spatially expanding species are affected by deleterious mutations, leading to a drastic impairment of their evolutionary potential.},

We examine the impact of two genetic processes and their interaction on fitness at expanding range edges: local maladaptation resulting from the presence of an environmental gradient and expansion load resulting from increased genetic drift at the range edge. Results from spatially explicit simulations indicate that the presence of an environmental gradient during range expansion reduces expansion load; conversely, increasing expansion load allows only locally adapted populations to persist at the range edge. Increased maladaptation reduces the speed of range expansion, resulting in less genetic drift at the expanding front and more immigration from the range center, therefore reducing expansion load at the range edge. These results may have ramifications for species being forced to shift their ranges because of climate change or other anthropogenic changes. If rapidly changing climate leads to faster expansion as populations track their shifting climatic optima, populations may suffer increased expansion load beyond previous expectations.},

abstract = {Significance Microbes often live in dense populations such as colonies and biofilms. We show that the success and extinction of yeast strains within a growing colony are determined by a combination of their relative fitness and the forces exerted by proliferating cells on their neighbors. These physical interactions prolong the survival of less-fit strains at the growing frontier of the colony and slow down the colony’s takeover by fitter strains. This reduction in the power of natural selection favors the maintenance of genetic diversity in environments in which the strains’ relative growth rates vary with time. Growth-induced physical interactions may thus favor the maintenance of drug-resistant cells, which are typically less fit than nonresistant cells, within dense microbial populations. Microbial populations often assemble in dense populations in which proliferating individuals exert mechanical forces on the nearby cells. Here, we use yeast strains whose doubling times depend differently on temperature to show that physical interactions among cells affect the competition between different genotypes in growing yeast colonies. Our experiments demonstrate that these physical interactions have two related effects: they cause the prolonged survival of slower-growing strains at the actively-growing frontier of the colony and cause faster-growing strains to increase their frequency more slowly than expected in the absence of physical interactions. These effects also promote the survival of slower-growing strains and the maintenance of genetic diversity in colonies grown in time-varying environments. A continuum model inspired by overdamped hydrodynamics reproduces the experiments and predicts that the strength of natural selection depends on the width of the actively growing layer at the colony frontier. We verify these predictions experimentally. The reduced power of natural selection observed here may favor the maintenance of drug-resistant cells in microbial populations and could explain the apparent neutrality of interclone competition within tumors.},

abstract = {Expanding populations incur a mutation burden – the so-called expansion load. Previous studies of expansion load have focused on co-dominant mutations. An important consequence of this assumption is that expansion load stems exclusively from the accumulation of new mutations occurring in individuals living at the wave front. Using individual-based simulations we study here the dynamics of standing genetic variation at the front of expansions, and its consequences on mean fitness if mutations are recessive. We find that deleterious genetic diversity is quickly lost at the front of the expansion, but the loss of deleterious mutations at some loci is compensated by an increase of their frequencies at other loci. The frequency of deleterious homozygotes therefore increases along the expansion axis whereas the average number of deleterious mutations per individual remains nearly constant across the species range. This reveals two important differences to co-dominant models: (i) mean fitness at the front of the expansion drops much faster if mutations are recessive, and (ii) mutation load can increase during the expansion even if the total number of deleterious mutations per individual remains constant. We use our model to make predictions about the shape of the site frequency spectrum at the front of range expansion, and about correlations between heterozygosity and fitness in different parts of the species range. Importantly, these predictions provide opportunities to empirically validate our theoretical results. We discuss our findings in the light of recent results on the distribution of deleterious genetic variation across human populations, and link them to empirical results on the correlation of heterozygosity and fitness found in many natural range expansions.},

abstract = {Bacterial populations have been shown to accumulate deleterious mutations during spatial expansions that overall decrease their fitness and ability to grow. However, it is unclear if and how they can respond to selection in face of this mutation load. We examine here if artificial selection can counteract the negative effects of range expansions. We examined the molecular evolution of 20 mutator lines selected for fast expansions (SEL) and compared them to 20 other mutator lines freely expanding without artificial selection (CONTROL). We find that the colony size of all 20 SEL lines have increased relative to the ancestral lines, unlike CONTROL lines, showing that enough beneficial mutations are produced during spatial expansions to counteract the negative effect of expansion load. Importantly, SEL and CONTROL lines have similar numbers of mutations indicating that they evolved for the same number of generations and that increased fitness is not due to a purging of deleterious mutations. We find that loss of function (LOF) mutations better explain the increased colony size of SEL lines than non-synonymous mutations or a combination of the two. Interestingly, most LOF mutations are found in simple sequence repeats (SSR) located in genes involved in gene regulation and gene expression. We postulate that such potentially reversible mutations could play a major role in the rapid adaptation of bacteria to changing environmental conditions by shutting down expensive genes and adjusting gene expression.},

abstract = {Bacterial conglomerates such as biofilms and microcolonies are ubiquitous in nature and play an important role in industry and medicine. In contrast to well-mixed, diluted cultures routinely used in microbial research, bacteria in a microcolonv interact mechanically with one another and with the substrate to which they are attached. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about the role of such mechanical interactions on growth and biological evolution of microbial populations. Here we use a computer model of a microbial colony of rod-shaped cells to investigate how physical interactions between cells determine their motion in the colony, this affects biological evolution. We show that the probability that a faster-growing mutant “surfs” at the colony’s frontier and creates a macroscopic sector depends on physical properties of cells (shape, elasticity, friction). Although all these factors contribute to the surfing probability in seemingly different ways, they all ultimately exhibit their effects by altering the roughness of the expanding frontier of the colony and the orientation of cells. Our predictions are confirmed by experiments in which we measure the surfing probability for colonies of different front roughness. Our results show that physical interactions between bacterial cells play an important role in biological evolution of new traits, and suggest that these interaction may be relevant to processes such as de novo evolution of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Significance It is crucial to understand what governs the growth and spread of populations colonizing novel environments to better predict species responses to global change, including range shifts in response to warming and biological invasions. Evolutionary processes can be rapid enough to influence colonizing populations; however, it is unclear whether evolution governs the course of colonization events or if it is an outcome that arises gradually after successful establishment. We either allowed or restricted evolution in replicate populations released in a novel environment, and found that populations that were allowed to evolve grew three times larger and expanded their ranges 46% faster compared with nonevolving populations. Thus, evolution facilitates colonization from the outset and should be considered in management decisions. Colonization and expansion into novel landscapes determine the distribution and abundance of species in our rapidly changing ecosystems worldwide. Colonization events are crucibles for rapid evolution, but it is not known whether evolutionary changes arise mainly after successful colonization has occurred, or if evolution plays an immediate role, governing the growth and expansion speed of colonizing populations. There is evidence that spatial evolutionary processes can speed range expansion within a few generations because dispersal tendencies may evolve upwards at range edges. Additionally, rapid adaptation to a novel environment can increase population growth rates, which also promotes spread. However, the role of adaptive evolution and the relative contributions of spatial evolution and adaptation to expansion are unclear. Using a model system, red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum), we either allowed or constrained evolution of populations colonizing a novel environment and measured population growth and spread. At the end of the experiment we assessed the fitness and dispersal tendency of individuals originating either from the core or edge of evolving populations or from nonevolving populations in a common garden. Within six generations, evolving populations grew three times larger and spread 46% faster than populations in which evolution was constrained. Increased size and expansion speed were strongly driven by adaptation, whereas spatial evolutionary processes acting on edge subpopulations contributed less. This experimental evidence demonstrates that rapid evolution drives both population growth and expansion speed and is thus crucial to consider for managing biological invasions and successfully introducing or reintroducing species for management and conservation.},

abstract = {Range expansions and biological invasions are prime examples of transient processes that are likely impacted by rapid evolutionary changes. As a spatial process, range expansions are driven by dispersal and movement behaviour. Although it is widely accepted that dispersal and movement may be context‐dependent, for instance density‐dependent, and best represented by reaction norms, the evolution of density‐dependent movement during range expansions has received little experimental attention. We therefore tested current theory predicting the evolution of increased movement at low densities at range margins using highly replicated and controlled range expansion experiments across multiple genotypes of the protist model system Tetrahymena thermophila. Although rare, we found evolutionary changes during range expansions even in the absence of initial standing genetic variation. Range expansions led to the evolution of negatively density‐dependent movement at range margins. In addition, we report the evolution of increased intrastrain competitive ability and concurrently decreased population growth rates in range cores. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding movement and dispersal as evolving reaction norms and plastic life‐history traits of central relevance for range expansions, biological invasions and the dynamics of spatially structured systems in general.},

abstract = {Range expansions are crucibles for rapid evolution, acting via both selective and neutral mechanisms. While selection on traits such as dispersal and fecundity may increase expansion speed, neutral mechanisms arising from repeated bottlenecks and genetic drift in edge populations (i.e. gene surfing) could slow spread or make it less predictable. Thus, it is necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from neutral mechanisms to robustly predict expansion dynamics. This is difficult to do with expansions in nature, as replicated expansions are required to distinguish selective and neutral processes in the genome. Using replicated microcosms of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), we identify a robust signature of stochastic, neutral mechanisms in genomic changes arising over only eight generations of expansion and assess the role of standing variation and de novo mutations in driving these changes. Average genetic diversity was reduced within edge populations, but with substantial among-replicate variability in the changes at specific genomic windows. Such variability in genomic changes is consistent with a large role for stochastic, neutral processes. This increased genomic divergence among populations was mirrored by heightened variation in population size and expansion speed, suggesting that stochastic variation in the genome could increase unpredictability of range expansions.},

abstract = {Bacterial populations have been shown to accumulate deleterious mutations during spatial expansions that overall decrease their fitness and ability to grow. However, it is unclear if and how they can respond to selection in face of this mutation load. We examine here if artificial selection can counteract the negative effects of range expansions. We investigated the molecular evolution of 20 lines (SEL) selected for fast expansions and compared them to 20 lines without artificial selection (CONTROL). We find that all 20 SEL lines have been able to increase their expansion speed relative to the ancestral line, unlike CONTROL lines, showing that enough beneficial mutations are produced during spatial expansions to counteract the negative effect of expansion load. Importantly, SEL and CONTROL lines have similar numbers of mutations indicating that they evolved for the same number of generations and that increased fitness is not due to a purging of deleterious mutations. We find that loss of function (LOF) mutations are better at explaining the increased expansion speed of SEL lines than non-synonymous mutations or a combination of the two. Interestingly, most LOF mutations are found in simple sequence repeats located in genes involved in gene regulation and gene expression. We postulate that such potentially reversible mutations could play a major role in the rapid adaptation of bacteria to changing environmental conditions by shutting down expensive genes and adjusting gene expression. Author Summary We investigated if strong artificial selection for fast expansion can counteract the negative effects of range expansion which had been shown to lead to an accumulation of deleterious mutations. This experiments showed that i) an increase in expansion speed could occur if bacteria were selected from the largest protruding sectors, and ii) that artificially selected bacterial lines accumulated about the same number of mutations than simply expanding line suggesting that the observed increased fitness is not due to increased purifying selection where deleterious mutations would have been removed in fast growing lines. We find that loss of function (LOF) mutations are best explaining the observed increased expansion speed in selected lines. These mutations, which are known to play an important role in adaptive processes in bacterial populations, frequently consist in small insertion-deletions in simple sequence repeats, and are thus relatively easily reversible. They could thus act as switches that can reversibly shut down genes. Our results therefore suggest that shutting down expensive genes and adjusting gene expression are important for adaptive processes during range expansion.},

abstract = {Author(s): Gralka, Matti | Advisor(s): Hallatschek, Oskar | Abstract: Traditionally, evolutionary biology has mostly taken a retrospective view, looking backwards in time to infer past evolutionary dynamics. Over the past 30 years, evolution experiments in the laboratory have become a valuable complementary technique to study evolution in real time. Microbial populations in shaken flasks are an ideal model system to do this, because their short generation times and easy reproducibility allow for the study of dozens to hundreds of replicates. Our understanding of microbial evolution in these simple laboratory environments has dramatically improved in recent years.Microbial populations in the wild face vastly more complex conditions: they grow as spatially structured communities called microbial biofilms, often consisting of interacting mixtures of different species fulfilling different purposes, subject to various, potentially self-generated, biophysicochemical gradients of, e.g., oxygen or nutrients, which are in turn altered by the physical structure of the community. In short, natural population are subject to a vast variety of ecological interactions, and it has remained unclear how much can be learned from well-mixed liquid culture experiments about how ecology affects evolution in more complex scenarios. In this dissertation, I approach this question using one of the simplest possible ecological aspects: the fact that most populations grow in spatially structured communities. Using microbial colonies as an experimental model system, I examine the effect of spatial structure on evolutionary dynamics in a variety of ways. First, Chapters 2-4 investigate the fates of neutral mutations and the dynamics of beneficial mutations in microbial colonies to find that both the neutral diversity resulting from spontaneous mutations and the strength of adaptation is increased in colonies compared to microbial populations grown in shaken flasks. The second half of the thesis is concerned with the effects of environmental heterogeneity on evolutionary dynamics. In Chapter 5, randomly disordered environments are used to examine the competition of selection and extrinsic noise in a model system for spontaneous beneficial and deleterious mutations. In these experiments, extrinsic noise can almost entirely overpower selection such that beneficial variants cannot leverage their advantage to further their evolutionary success. Chapter 6 discusses the effects of gradients on the emergence of antibiotic resistance and how convective flow can shape the trade-off between selection for resistance and the efficacy of treatment. Overall, the results presented in this thesis suggest that spatial structure can have a momentous influence on the evolutionary dynamics of many dense cellular populations like biofilms and tumors: not only do the dynamics of adaptation change quantitatively in spatially structured populations, but qualitatively different patterns of evolutionary dynamics emerge that cannot arise in well-mixed population. Environmental heterogeneity can also have a strong influence on the speed and the direction of adaptation: whereas random heterogeneity in the environment prevents the spread of beneficial variants, the presence of antibiotic gradients can facilitate the rapid emergence of resistance. This work thus offers a glimpse into the profound and complex ways in which ecology can impact evolution even in simple model systems.},

abstract = {Range expansions cause a series of founder events. We show that, in a one-dimensional habitat, these founder events are the spatial analog of genetic drift in a randomly mating population. The spatial series of allele frequencies created by successive founder events is equivalent to the time series of allele frequencies in a population of effective size ke, the effective number of founders. We derive an expression for ke in a discrete-population model that allows for local population growth and migration among established populations. If there is selection, the net effect is determined approximately by the product of the selection coefficients and the number of generations between successive founding events. We use the model of a single population to compute analytically several quantities for an allele present in the source population: (i) the probability that it survives the series of colonization events, (ii) the probability that it reaches a specified threshold frequency in the last population, and (iii) the mean and variance of the frequencies in each population. We show that the analytic theory provides a good approximation to simulation results. A consequence of our approximation is that the average heterozygosity of neutral alleles decreases by a factor of 1 – 1/(2ke) in each new population. Therefore, the population genetic consequences of surfing can be predicted approximately by the effective number of founders and the effective selection coefficients, even in the presence of migration among populations. We also show that our analytic results are applicable to a model of range expansion in a continuously distributed population.},

These range changes affect the dynamics of biological evolution in multiple ways. Recent microbial experiments as well as simulations suggest that enhanced genetic drift at the frontier of a two‐dimensional range expansion can cause genetic sectoring patterns with fractal domain boundaries. Here, we propose and analyze a simple model of asexual biological evolution at expanding frontiers that explains these neutral patterns and predicts the effect of natural selection. We find that beneficial mutations give rise to sectors with an opening angle that depends sensitively on the selective advantage of the mutants. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, are not able to establish a sector permanently. They can, however, temporarily “surf” on the population front, and thereby reach unusually high frequencies. As a consequence, expanding frontiers are loaded with a high fraction of mutants at mutation–selection balance. Numerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in favor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front. Our prediction for this error threshold differs qualitatively from existing well‐mixed theories, and sets tight constraints on sustainable mutation rates for populations that undergo frequent range expansions.},

abstract = {Expanding populations incur a mutation burden, the so-called expansion load. Using a mixture of individual-based simulations and analytical modeling, we study the expansion load process in models where population growth depends on the population’s fitness (i.e., hard selection). We show that expansion load can severely slow down expansions and limit a species’ range, even in the absence of environmental variation. We also study the effect of recombination on the dynamics of a species range and on the evolution of mean fitness on the wave front. If recombination is strong, mean fitness on front approaches an equilibrium value at which the effects of fixed mutations cancel each other out. The equilibrium rate at which new demes are colonized is similar to the rate at which beneficial mutations spread through the core. Without recombination, the dynamics is more complex, and beneficial mutations from the core of the range can invade the front of the expansion, which results in irregular and episodic expansion. Although the rate of adaptation is generally higher in recombining organisms, the mean fitness on the front may be larger in the absence of recombination because high-fitness individuals from the core have a higher chance to invade the front. Our findings have important consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of species ranges as well as on the role and the evolution of recombination during range expansions.},

In this perspective article, we aim to emphasize that these forces act at the population level, and that it is a challenge to understand how they emerge from the stochastic and deterministic behaviour of individual cells. Even the most basic steric interactions between neighbouring cells can couple evolutionary outcomes of otherwise unrelated individuals, thereby weakening natural selection and enhancing random genetic drift. Using microbial examples of varying degrees of complexity, we demonstrate how strongly cell–cell interactions influence evolutionary dynamics, especially in pattern-forming systems. As pattern formation itself is subject to evolution, we propose to study the feedback between pattern formation and evolutionary dynamics, which could be key to predicting and potentially steering evolutionary processes.

abstract = {Many theoretical and experimental studies suggest that range expansions can have severe consequences for the gene pool of the expanding population. Due to strongly enhanced genetic drift at the advancing frontier, neutral and weakly deleterious mutations can reach large frequencies in the newly colonized regions, as if they were surfing the front of the range expansion. These findings raise the question of how frequently beneficial mutations successfully surf at shifting range margins, thereby promoting adaptation towards a range-expansion phenotype. Here, we use individual-based simulations to study the surfing statistics of recurrent beneficial mutations on wave-like range expansions in linear habitats. We show that the rate of surfing depends on two strongly antagonistic factors, the probability of surfing given the spatial location of a novel mutation and the rate of occurrence of mutations at that location. The surfing probability strongly increases towards the tip of the wave. Novel mutations are unlikely to surf unless they enjoy a spatial head start compared to the bulk of the population. The needed head start is shown to be proportional to the inverse fitness of the mutant type, and only weakly dependent on the carrying capacity. The precise location dependence of surfing probabilities is derived from the non-extinction probability of a branching process within a moving field of growth rates. The second factor is the mutation occurrence which strongly decreases towards the tip of the wave. Thus, most successful mutations arise at an intermediate position in the front of the wave. We present an analytic theory for the tradeoff between these factors that allows to predict how frequently substitutions by beneficial mutations occur at invasion fronts. We find that small amounts of genetic drift increase the fixation rate of beneficial mutations at the advancing front, and thus could be important for adaptation during species invasions.},
