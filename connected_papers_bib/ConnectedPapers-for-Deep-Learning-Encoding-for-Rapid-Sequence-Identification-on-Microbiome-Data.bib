abstract = {We present a novel approach for rapidly identifying sequences that leverages the representational power of Deep Learning techniques and is applied to the analysis of microbiome data. The method involves the creation of a latent sequence space, training a convolutional neural network to rapidly identify sequences by mapping them into that space, and we leverage the novel encoded latent space for denoising to correct sequencing errors. Using mock bacterial communities of known composition, we show that this approach achieves single nucleotide resolution, generating results for sequence identification and abundance estimation that match the best available microbiome algorithms in terms of accuracy while vastly increasing the speed of accurate processing. We further show the ability of this approach to support phenotypic prediction at the sample level on an experimental data set for which the ground truth for sequence identities and abundances is unknown, but the expected phenotypes of the samples are definitive. Moreover, this approach offers a potential solution for the analysis of data from other types of experiments that currently rely on computationally intensive sequence identification.},

abstract = {Amplicon high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is currently the most widely used technique to investigate complex gut microbial communities. Microbial identification might be influenced by several factors, including the choice of bioinformatic pipelines, making comparisons across studies difficult. Here, we compared four commonly used pipelines (QIIME2, Bioconductor, UPARSE and mothur) run on two operating systems (OS) (Linux and Mac), to evaluate the impact of bioinformatic pipeline and OS on the taxonomic classification of 40 human stool samples. We applied the SILVA 132 reference database for all the pipelines. We compared phyla and genera identification and relative abundances across the four pipelines using the Friedman rank sum test. QIIME2 and Bioconductor provided identical outputs on Linux and Mac OS, while UPARSE and mothur reported only minimal differences between OS. Taxa assignments were consistent at both phylum and genus level across all the pipelines. However, a difference in terms of relative abundance was identified for all phyla (p < 0.013) and for the majority of the most abundant genera (p < 0.028), such as Bacteroides (QIIME2: 24.5%, Bioconductor: 24.6%, UPARSE-linux: 23.6%, UPARSE-mac: 20.6%, mothur-linux: 22.2%, mothur-mac: 21.6%, p < 0.001). The use of different bioinformatic pipelines affects the estimation of the relative abundance of gut microbial community, indicating that studies using different pipelines cannot be directly compared. A harmonization procedure is needed to move the field forward.},

abstract = {Amplicon sequencing is widely implemented in microbiome‐associated studies. In recent years, microbial ecologists have switched to new algorithms for taxonomic identification and quantification. The amplicon sequence variant (ASV) denoising algorithm of unbiased sequence picking has replaced the OTU clustering methods. ASV can be used to detect and distinguish biological variations to the species OTU level (≥97% similarity). However, the ASV quantification among samples is sparse and less prevalent within the same batch. Here, we present a k‐mer based, alignment‐free algorithm—‘KTU’ (K‐mer Taxonomic Unit)—to iteratively re‐cluster ASVs into optimal biological taxonomic units. The ‘KTU’ algorithm comprises four parts: (a) The k‐mer frequency calling is sliding window counted by tetranucleotide frequencies from both ends of the DNA sequence. (b) The similarities in k‐mer frequencies among the sequences are measured by cosine dissimilarity. (c) The KTUs are detected from the cosine dissimilarity matrix using the partition around medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm. The iterative PAM‐KTU detecting process searches for the numbers of KTU convergent clusters according to the maximum silhouette coefficient. (d) Finally, the ASVs are aggregated into the corresponding KTUs. KTU re‐clustered every 1.38–4.53 ASVs into a feature with >99% sequence similarity on average and 1% cosine divergence for each KTU. Additionally, the re‐clustering procedure improved biological explanations for correlations and significances of clinical and environmental factors.},

abstract = {Background: Taxonomic classification of marker-gene sequences is an important step in microbiome analysis. Results: We present q2-feature-classifier (https://github.com/qiime2/q2-feature-classifier), a QIIME 2 plugin containing several novel machine-learning and alignment-based methods for taxonomy classification. We evaluated and optimized several commonly used classification methods implemented in QIIME 1 (RDP, BLAST, UCLUST, and SortMeRNA) and several new methods implemented in QIIME 2 (a scikit-learn naive Bayes machine-learning classifier, and alignment-based taxonomy consensus methods based on VSEARCH, and BLAST+) for classification of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker-gene amplicon sequence data. The naive-Bayes, BLAST+-based, and VSEARCH-based classifiers implemented in QIIME 2 meet or exceed the species-level accuracy of other commonly used methods designed for classification of marker gene sequences that were evaluated in this work. These evaluations, based on 19 mock communities and error-free sequence simulations, including classification of simulated “novel” marker-gene sequences, are available in our extensible benchmarking framework, tax-credit (https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit-data). Conclusions: Our results illustrate the importance of parameter tuning for optimizing classifier performance, and we make recommendations regarding parameter choices for these classifiers under a range of standard operating conditions. q2-feature-classifier and tax-credit are both free, open-source, BSD-licensed packages available on GitHub. Background High-throughput sequencing technologies have transformed our ability to explore complex microbial communities, offering insight into microbial impacts on human health [1] and global ecosystems [2]. This is achieved most commonly by sequencing short, conserved marker genes amplified with ‘universal’ PCR primers, such as 16S rRNA genes for bacteria and archaea, or internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions for fungi. Targeted marker-gene primers can also be used to profile specific taxa or functional groups, such as nifH genes [3]. These sequences often are compared against an annotated reference sequence database to determine the likely taxonomic origin of each sequence with as much specificity as possible. Accurate and specific taxonomic information is a crucial component of many experimental designs. Challenges in this process include the short length of typical sequencing reads with current technology, sequencing and PCR errors [4], selection of appropriate marker genes that contain sufficient heterogeneity to differentiate target species but that are homogeneous enough in some regions to design broad-spectrum primers, quality of reference sequence annotations [5], and selection of a method that accurately predicts the taxonomic affiliation of millions of sequences at low computational cost.

abstract = {Microbial amplicon sequencing studies are an important tool in biological and biomedical research. Widespread 16S rRNA gene microbial surveys have shed light on the structure of many ecosystems inhabited by bacteria, including the human body. However, specialized software and algorithms are needed to convert raw sequencing data into biologically meaningful information (i.e. tables of bacterial counts). While different bioinformatic pipelines are available in a rapidly changing and improving field, users are often unaware of limitations and biases associated with individual pipelines and there is a lack of agreement regarding best practices. Here, we compared six bioinformatic pipelines for the analysis of amplicon sequence data: three OTU-level flows (QIIME-uclust, MOTHUR, and USEARCH-UPARSE) and three ASV-level (DADA2, Qiime2-Deblur, and USEARCH-UNOISE3). We tested workflows with different quality control options, clustering algorithms, and cutoff parameters on a mock community as well as on a large (N = 2170) recently published fecal sample dataset from the multi-ethnic HELIUS study. We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and degree of consensus of the different outputs. DADA2 offered the best sensitivity, at the expense of decreased specificity compared to USEARCH-UNOISE3 and Qiime2-Deblur. USEARCH-UNOISE3 showed the best balance between resolution and specificity. OTU-level USEARCH-UPARSE and MOTHUR performed well, but with lower specificity than ASV-level pipelines. QIIME-uclust produced large number of spurious OTUs as well as inflated alpha-diversity measures and should be avoided in future studies. This study provides guidance for researchers using amplicon sequencing to gain biological insights.},

abstract = {Although clustering by operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is widely used in the oral microbial literature, no research has specifically evaluated the extent of the limitations of this sequence clustering-based method in the oral microbiome. Consequently, our objectives were to: 1) evaluate in-silico the coverage of a set of previously selected primer pairs to detect oral species having 16S rRNA sequence segments with ≥97% similarity; 2) describe oral species with highly similar sequence segments and determine whether they belong to distinct genera or other higher taxonomic ranks. Thirty-nine primer pairs were employed to obtain the in-silico amplicons from the complete genomes of 186 bacterial and 135 archaeal species. Each fasta file for the same primer pair was inserted as subject and query in BLASTN for obtaining the similarity percentage between amplicons belonging to different oral species. Amplicons with 100% alignment coverage of the query sequences and with an amplicon similarity value ≥97% (ASI97) were selected. For each primer, the species coverage with no ASI97 (SC-NASI97) was calculated. Based on the SC-NASI97 parameter, the best primer pairs were OP_F053-KP_R020 for bacteria (region V1-V3; primer pair position for Escherichia coli J01859.1: 9-356); KP_F018-KP_R002 for archaea (V4; undefined-532); and OP_F114-KP_R031 for both (V3-V5; 340-801). Around 80% of the oral-bacteria and oral-archaea species analyzed had an ASI97 with at least one other species. These very similar species play different roles in the oral microbiota and belong to bacterial genera such as Campylobacter, Rothia, Streptococcus and Tannerella, and archaeal genera such as Halovivax, Methanosarcina and Methanosalsum. Moreover, ~20% and ~30% of these two-by-two similarity relationships were established between species from different bacterial and archaeal genera, respectively. Even taxa from distinct families, orders, and classes could be grouped in the same possible OTU. Consequently, regardless of the primer pair used, sequence clustering with a 97% similarity provides an inaccurate description of oral-bacterial and oral-archaeal species, which can greatly affect microbial diversity parameters. As a result, OTU clustering conditions the credibility of associations between some oral species and certain health and disease conditions. This significantly limits the comparability of the microbial diversity findings reported in oral microbiome literature.},

abstract = {Validated methods are urgently needed to improve DNA sequence-based assessments of complex bacterial communities. In this study, we used 16S rRNA PCR amplicon and gDNA mock community standards, consisting of nine, dairy-associated bacterial species, to evaluate the most commonly applied 16S rRNA marker gene DNA sequencing and analysis platforms used in evaluating dairy and other bacterial habitats. Our results show that bacterial metataxonomic assessments are largely dependent on the DNA sequencing platform and read curation method used. DADA2 improved sequence annotation compared with QIIME 1, and when combined with the Ion Torrent PGM DNA sequencing platform and the Greengenes database for taxonomic assignment, the most accurate representation of the dairy mock community standards was reached. This approach will be useful for validating sample collection and DNA extraction methods and ultimately investigating bacterial population dynamics in milk- and dairy-associated environments. ABSTRACT DNA sequencing and analysis methods were compared for 16S rRNA V4 PCR amplicon and genomic DNA (gDNA) mock communities encompassing nine bacterial species commonly found in milk and dairy products. The two communities comprised strain-specific DNA that was pooled before (gDNA) or after (PCR amplicon) the PCR step. The communities were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM platforms and then analyzed using the QIIME 1 (UCLUST) and Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2 (DADA2) analysis pipelines with taxonomic comparisons to the Greengenes and Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) databases. Examination of the PCR amplicon mock community with these methods resulted in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that ranged from 13 to 118 and were dependent on the DNA sequencing method and read assembly steps. The additional 4 to 109 OTUs/ASVs (from 9 OTUs/ASVs) included assignments to spurious taxa and sequence variants of the 9 species included in the mock community. Comparisons between the gDNA and PCR amplicon mock communities showed that combining gDNAs from the different strains prior to PCR resulted in up to 8.9-fold greater numbers of spurious OTUs/ASVs. However, the DNA sequencing method and paired-end read assembly steps conferred the largest effects on predictions of bacterial diversity, with effect sizes of 0.88 (Bray-Curtis) and 0.32 (weighted Unifrac), independent of the mock community type. Overall, DNA sequencing performed with the Ion Torrent PGM and analyzed with DADA2 and the Greengenes database resulted in the most accurate predictions of the mock community phylogeny, taxonomy, and diversity. IMPORTANCE Validated methods are urgently needed to improve DNA sequence-based assessments of complex bacterial communities. In this study, we used 16S rRNA PCR amplicon and gDNA mock community standards, consisting of nine, dairy-associated bacterial species, to evaluate the most commonly applied 16S rRNA marker gene DNA sequencing and analysis platforms used in evaluating dairy and other bacterial habitats.

abstract = {Background: The human intestinal microbiome plays a central role in overall health status, especially in early life stages. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing is used to profile its taxonomic composition; however, multiomic approaches have been proposed as the most accurate methods for study of the complexity of the gut microbiota. In this study, we propose an optimized method for bacterial diversity analysis that we validated and complemented with metabolomics by analyzing fecal samples. Methods: Forty-eight different analytical combinations regarding (1) 16S rRNA variable region sequencing, (2) a feature selection approach, and (3) taxonomy assignment methods were tested. A total of 18 infant fecal samples grouped depending on the type of feeding were analyzed by the proposed 16S rRNA workflow and by metabolomic analysis. Results: The results showed that the sole use of V4 region sequencing with ASV identification and VSEARCH for taxonomy assignment produced the most accurate results. The application of this workflow showed clear differences between fecal samples according to the type of feeding, which correlated with changes in the fecal metabolic profile. Conclusion: A multiomic approach using real fecal samples from 18 infants with different types of feeding demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed 16S rRNA-amplicon sequencing workflow.},

abstract = {Motivation Next-generation amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for investigating microbial communities. One main challenge is to distinguish true biological variants from errors caused by PCR and sequencing. In the traditional analysis pipeline, such errors are eliminated by clustering reads within a sequence similarity threshold, usually 97%, and constructing operational taxonomic units, but the arbitrary threshold leads to low resolution and high false positive rates. Recently developed “denoising” methods have proven able to resolve single-nucleotide amplicon variants, but they still miss low frequency sequences, especially those near abundant variants, because they ignore the sequencing quality information. Results We introduce AmpliCI, a reference-free, model-based method for rapidly resolving the number, abundance and identity of error-free sequences in massive Illumina amplicon datasets. AmpliCI takes into account quality information and allows the data, not an arbitrary threshold or an external database, to drive conclusions. AmpliCI estimates a finite mixture model, using a greedy strategy to gradually select error-free sequences and approximately maximize the likelihood. We show that AmpliCI is superior to three popular denoising methods, with acceptable computation time and memory usage. Availability Source code available at https://github.com/DormanLab/AmpliCI},

abstract = {The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing is a widely used high-throughput method for the taxonomic inference in microbial communities. Many data analysis pipelines have been developed to enhance the accuracy in reflecting the real taxonomy, in order to better guide the downstream identification, isolation and mechanistic studies. Though rigorous quality filtration steps were adopted in these pipelines, with well-designed mock and simulated data sets, we found that there were still a widely divergent number of spurious features due to the “pseudo sequences” artificially generated during the PCR and sequencing process. These pseudo sequences were in low abundances, and were unreliable determined through a weighted re-sampling test. To minimize their influences on the characterization of taxonomy, we proposed an approach that contains two steps, an abundance filtering (AF) step and the subsequent AF-based OTU picking and remapping (AOR) step, which can efficiently decrease the spurious OTUs, sequences or oligotyping features, and improve Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) values in OTU clustering. The approach can be easily integrated with the popularly-used 16S rRNA sequencing data analysis pipelines, to make the number of OTUs, alpha and beta diversities from divergent pipelines more consistent with the real structure of microbial communities.},

abstract = {Background Sequencing of amplified genetic markers, such as the 16S rRNA gene, have been extensively used to characterize microbial community composition. Recent studies suggested that Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASV) should replace the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU), given the arbitrary definition of sequence identity thresholds used to define units. Alignment-free methods are an interesting alternative for the taxonomic classification of the ASVs, preventing the introduction of biases from sequence identity thresholds. Results Here we present TAG.ME, a novel alignment-independent and amplicon-specific method for taxonomic assignment based on genetic markers. TAG.ME uses a multilevel supervised learning approach to create predictive models based on user-defined genetic marker genes. The predictive method can assign taxonomy to sequenced amplicons efficiently and effectively. We applied our method to assess gut and soil sample classification, and it outperformed alternative approaches, identifying a substantially larger proportion of species. Benchmark tests performed using the RDP database, and Mock communities reinforced the precise classification into deep taxonomic levels. Conclusion TAG.ME presents a new approach to assign taxonomy to amplicon sequences accurately. Our classification model, trained with amplicon specific sequences, can address resolution issues not solved by other methods and approaches that use the whole 16S rRNA gene sequence.

abstract = {Background Amplicon sequencing is an established and cost-efficient method for profiling microbiomes. However, many available tools to process this data require both bioinformatics skills and high computational power to process big datasets. Furthermore, there are only few tools that allow for long read amplicon data analysis. To bridge this gap, we developed the LotuS2 (Less OTU Scripts 2) pipeline, enabling user-friendly, resource friendly, and versatile analysis of raw amplicon sequences. Results In LotuS2, six different sequence clustering algorithms as well as extensive pre- and post-processing options allow for flexible data analysis by both experts, where parameters can be fully adjusted, and novices, where defaults are provided for different scenarios. We benchmarked three independent gut and soil datasets, where LotuS2 was on average 29 times faster compared to other pipelines - yet could better reproduce the alpha- and beta-diversity of technical replicate samples. Further benchmarking a mock community with known taxa composition showed that, compared to the other pipelines, LotuS2 recovered a higher fraction of correctly identified genera and species (98% and 57%, respectively). At ASV/OTU level, precision and F-score were highest for LotuS2, as was the fraction of correctly reconstructed 16S sequences. Conclusion LotuS2 is a lightweight and user-friendly pipeline that is fast, precise and streamlined. High data usage rates and reliability enable high-throughput microbiome analysis in minutes.

abstract = {Prediction of taxonomy for marker gene sequences such as 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a fundamental task in microbiology. Most experimentally observed sequences are diverged from reference sequences of authoritatively named organisms, creating a challenge for prediction methods. I assessed the accuracy of several algorithms using cross-validation by identity, a new benchmark strategy which explicitly models the variation in distances between query sequences and the closest entry in a reference database. When the accuracy of genus predictions was averaged over a representative range of identities with the reference database (100%, 99%, 97%, 95% and 90%), all tested methods had ≤50% accuracy on the currently-popular V4 region of 16S rRNA. Accuracy was found to fall rapidly with identity; for example, better methods were found to have V4 genus prediction accuracy of ∼100% at 100% identity but ∼50% at 97% identity. The relationship between identity and taxonomy was quantified as the probability that a rank is the lowest shared by a pair of sequences with a given pair-wise identity. With the V4 region, 95% identity was found to be a twilight zone where taxonomy is highly ambiguous because the probabilities that the lowest shared rank between pairs of sequences is genus, family, order or class are approximately equal.},

abstract = {In 16S rRNA gene sequencing, certain bacterial genera were found to be underrepresented or even missing in taxonomic profiles when using unsuitable primer combinations, outdated reference databases, or inadequate pipeline settings. Concerning the last, quality thresholds as well as bioinformatic settings (i.e., clustering approach, analysis pipeline, and specific adjustments such as truncation) are responsible for a number of observed differences between studies. ABSTRACT Short-amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing is currently the method of choice for studies investigating microbiomes. However, comparative studies on differences in procedures are scarce. We sequenced human stool samples and mock communities with increasing complexity using a variety of commonly used protocols. Short amplicons targeting different variable regions (V-regions) or ranges thereof (V1-V2, V1-V3, V3-V4, V4, V4-V5, V6-V8, and V7-V9) were investigated for differences in the composition outcome due to primer choices. Next, the influence of clustering (operational taxonomic units [OTUs], zero-radius OTUs [zOTUs], and amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]), different databases (GreenGenes, the Ribosomal Database Project, Silva, the genomic-based 16S rRNA Database, and The All-Species Living Tree), and bioinformatic settings on taxonomic assignment were also investigated. We present a systematic comparison across all typically used V-regions using well-established primers. While it is known that the primer choice has a significant influence on the resulting microbial composition, we show that microbial profiles generated using different primer pairs need independent validation of performance. Further, comparing data sets across V-regions using different databases might be misleading due to differences in nomenclature (e.g., Enterorhabdus versus Adlercreutzia) and varying precisions in classification down to genus level. Overall, specific but important taxa are not picked up by certain primer pairs (e.g., Bacteroidetes is missed using primers 515F-944R) or due to the database used (e.g., Acetatifactor in GreenGenes and the genomic-based 16S rRNA Database). We found that appropriate truncation of amplicons is essential and different truncated-length combinations should be tested for each study. Finally, specific mock communities of sufficient and adequate complexity are highly recommended. IMPORTANCE In 16S rRNA gene sequencing, certain bacterial genera were found to be underrepresented or even missing in taxonomic profiles when using unsuitable primer combinations, outdated reference databases, or inadequate pipeline settings. Concerning the last, quality thresholds as well as bioinformatic settings (i.e., clustering approach, analysis pipeline, and specific adjustments such as truncation) are responsible for a number of observed differences between studies. Conclusions drawn by comparing one data set to another (e.g., between publications) appear to be problematic and require independent cross-validation using matching V-regions and uniform data processing. Therefore, we highlight the importance of a thought-out study design including sufficiently complex mock standards and appropriate V-region choice for the sample of interest. The use of processing pipelines and parameters must be tested beforehand.},

abstract = {Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene by Illumina next-generation sequencing is broadly used in microbiome studies. Different hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, V3V4 (amplified with primers 341F–805R) or V4 (V4O; primers 515F–806R), are selected, depending on the targeted resolution. However, in population-based clinical studies, combining V3V4 and V4 data from different studies for a meta-analysis is challenging. Reads generated by short-read (150-bp) high-throughput sequencing platforms do not fully recover the V4 region read-length. Here, we evaluated the compatibility of 16S rRNA V3V4 and V4 amplicons for microbiome profiling. We compared taxonomic compositions obtained by the analysis of V3V4 and V4 amplicons, and V4 fragments trimmed from V3V4 amplicons. We also evaluated an alternative V4 region (V4N; primers 519F–798R) designed for efficient stitching with 150-bp paired-end sequencing. First, we simulated a global investigation of environmental prokaryotes in silico. This revealed that V4O primers recovered the highest proportion of fragments (81.7%) and most phyla, including archaea. Empirical sequencing of standard (mock) and human fecal samples revealed biased patterns of each primer that were similar to the ones determined by in silico simulation. Further, for human fecal microbiome profiling, the between-sample variance was greater than the systematic bias of each primer. The use of trimmed V4 fragments and single-end amplicons resulted in the same systematic bias. In conclusion, paired-end V4O sequencing yielded the most accurate data for both, simulation and mock community sequencing; the V4O amplicons were compatible with trimmed V4 sequences for microbiome profiling. IMPORTANCE Next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is a commonly used approach for clinical microbiome studies. Different amplicons of the 16S rRNA hypervariable regions are used in different studies, which creates incompatible sequence features when comparing and integrating data among studies by using 16S denoising pipelines. Here we compared the type of data and coverage obtained when different 16S rRNA amplicons were analyzed. In silico and empirical analyses of the human fecal microbiome revealed that the V3V4 amplicons are compatible with V4 amplicons after trimming up to the same region. These observations demonstrate that reconciling the compatibility of clinical microbiome data from different studies improve not only the sample size but also the confidence of the hypothesis tested.},

abstract = {Marker gene sequencing of the rRNA operon (16S, 18S, ITS) or cytochrome c oxidase I (CO1) is a popular means to assess microbial communities of the environment, microbiomes associated with plants and animals, as well as communities of multicellular organisms via environmental DNA sequencing. Since this technique is based on sequencing a single gene, or even only parts of a single gene rather than the entire genome, the number of reads needed per sample to assess the microbial community structure is lower than that required for metagenome sequencing. This makes marker gene sequencing affordable to nearly any laboratory. Despite the relative ease and cost-efficiency of data generation, analyzing the resulting sequence data requires computational skills that may go beyond the standard repertoire of a current molecular biologist/ecologist. We have developed Cascabel, a scalable, flexible, and easy-to-use amplicon sequence data analysis pipeline, which uses Snakemake and a combination of existing and newly developed solutions for its computational steps. Cascabel takes the raw data as input and delivers a table of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) in BIOM and text format and representative sequences. Cascabel is a highly versatile software that allows users to customize several steps of the pipeline, such as selecting from a set of OTU clustering methods or performing ASV analysis. In addition, we designed Cascabel to run in any linux/unix computing environment from desktop computers to computing servers making use of parallel processing if possible. The analyses and results are fully reproducible and documented in an HTML and optional pdf report. Cascabel is freely available at Github: https://github.com/AlejandroAb/CASCABEL.},

abstract = {Illumina paired-end reads are often used for 16S analysis in metagenomic studies. Since DNA fragment size is usually smaller than the sum of lengths of paired reads, reads can be merged for downstream analysis. In spite of development of several tools for merging of paired-end reads, poor quality at the 3′ ends within the overlapping region prevents the accurate combining of significant portion of read pairs. Recently CD-HIT-OTU-Miseq was presented as a new approach for 16S analysis using the paired-end reads, it completely avoids the reads merging process due to separate clustering of paired reads. CD-HIT-OTU-Miseq is a set of tools which are supposed to be successively launched by auxiliary shell scripts. This launch mode is not suitable for processing of big amounts of data generated in modern omics experiments. To solve this issue we created CDSnake – Snakemake pipeline utilizing CD-HIT tools for easier consecutive launch of CD-HIT-OTU-Miseq tools for complete processing of paired end reads in metagenomic studies. Usage of pipeline make 16S analysis easier due to one-command launch and helps to yield reproducible results. We benchmarked our pipeline against two commonly used pipelines for OTU retrieval, incorporated into popular workflow for microbiome analysis, QIIME2 - DADA2 and deblur. Three mock datasets having highly overlapping paired-end 2 × 250 bp reads were used for benchmarking - Balanced, HMP, and Extreme. CDSnake outputted less OTUs than DADA2 and deblur. However, on Balanced and HMP datasets number of OTUs outputted by CDSnake was closer to real number of strains which were used for mock community generation, than those outputted by DADA2 and deblur. Though generally slower than other pipelines, CDSnake outputted higher total counts, preserving more information from raw data. Inheriting this properties from original CD-HIT-OTU-MiSeq utilities, CDSnake made their usage handier due to simple scalability, easier automated runs and other Snakemake benefits. We developed Snakemake pipeline for OTU-MiSeq utilities, which simplified and automated data analysis. Benchmarking showed that this approach is capable to outperform popular tools in certain conditions.},

Currently, there is no gold standard to infer and classify fungal constituents, in part since methodologies have been adapted from analyses of bacterial communities.

abstract = {High-depth sequencing of universal marker genes such as the 16S rRNA gene is a common strategy to profile microbial communities. Traditionally, sequence reads are clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a defined identity threshold to avoid sequencing errors generating spurious taxonomic units. However, there have been numerous bioinformatic packages recently released that attempt to correct sequencing errors to determine real biological sequences at single nucleotide resolution by generating amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). As more researchers begin to use high resolution ASVs, there is a need for an in-depth and unbiased comparison of these novel “denoising” pipelines. In this study, we conduct a thorough comparison of three of the most widely-used denoising packages (DADA2, UNOISE3, and Deblur) as well as an open-reference 97% OTU clustering pipeline on mock, soil, and host-associated communities. We found from the mock community analyses that although they produced similar microbial compositions based on relative abundance, the approaches identified vastly different numbers of ASVs that significantly impact alpha diversity metrics. Our analysis on real datasets using recommended settings for each denoising pipeline also showed that the three packages were consistent in their per-sample compositions, resulting in only minor differences based on weighted UniFrac and Bray–Curtis dissimilarity. DADA2 tended to find more ASVs than the other two denoising pipelines when analyzing both the real soil data and two other host-associated datasets, suggesting that it could be better at finding rare organisms, but at the expense of possible false positives. The open-reference OTU clustering approach identified considerably more OTUs in comparison to the number of ASVs from the denoising pipelines in all datasets tested. The three denoising approaches were significantly different in their run times, with UNOISE3 running greater than 1,200 and 15 times faster than DADA2 and Deblur, respectively. Our findings indicate that, although all pipelines result in similar general community structure, the number of ASVs/OTUs and resulting alpha-diversity metrics varies considerably and should be considered when attempting to identify rare organisms from possible background noise.},

The certainty of results, independent of the bioinformatic handling, is imperative for any advances made within the field. In this work, thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion experimental data, together with primary and waste-activated sludge prokaryotic community data, were analyzed with two pipelines that apply different principles when dealing with technical, sequencing, and PCR biases. One pipeline (VSEARCH) employs clustering methods, generating individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs), while the other (DADA2) is based on sequencing error correction algorithms and generates exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The outcomes of both pipelines were compared within the framework of ecological-driven data analysis. Both pipelines provided comparable results that would generally allow for the same interpretations. Yet, the two approaches also delivered community compositions that differed between 6.75% and 10.81% between pipelines. Inconsistencies were also observed linked to biologically driven variability in the samples, which affected the two pipelines differently. These pipeline-dependent differences in taxonomic assignment could lead to different conclusions and interfere with any downstream analysis made for such mis- or not-identified species, e.g., network analysis or predictions of their respective ecosystem service.},

This algorithm provides a solution to the problem of identifying real ecological differences between taxa whose amplicons differ by a single base pair, is applicable in an automated fashion to large-scale sequencing data sets, and can integrate sequencing runs collected over time. ABSTRACT High-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons has facilitated understanding of complex microbial communities, but the inherent noise in PCR and DNA sequencing limits differentiation of closely related bacteria. Although many scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic profiles, clinical, food safety, and some ecological applications require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight Deblur’s ability to integrate data sets, we include an interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, easily installable, and downloadable from https://github.com/biocore/deblur .

These steps optimized a robust fungal ITS1 sequencing pipeline that, in most instances, enabled species-level assignment of community members.},

abstract = {One of the major methods to identify microbial community composition, to unravel microbial population dynamics, and to explore microbial diversity in environmental samples is high-throughput DNA- or RNA-based 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequencing in combination with bioinformatics analyses. However, focusing on environmental samples from contrasting habitats, it was not systematically evaluated (i) which analysis methods provide results that reflect reality most accurately, (ii) how the interpretations of microbial community studies are biased by different analysis methods and (iii) if the most optimal analysis workflow can be implemented in an easy-to-use pipeline. Here, we compared the performance of 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequencing analysis tools (i.e., Mothur, QIIME1, QIIME2, and MEGAN) using three mock datasets with known microbial community composition that differed in sequencing quality, species number and abundance distribution (i.e., even or uneven), and phylogenetic diversity (i.e., closely related or well-separated amplicon sequences). Our results showed that QIIME2 outcompeted all other investigated tools in sequence recovery (>10 times fewer false positives), taxonomic assignments (>22% better F-score) and diversity estimates (>5% better assessment), suggesting that this approach is able to reflect the in situ microbial community most accurately. Further analysis of 24 environmental datasets obtained from four contrasting terrestrial and freshwater sites revealed dramatic differences in the resulting microbial community composition for all pipelines at genus level. For instance, at the investigated river water sites Sphaerotilus was only reported when using QIIME1 (8% abundance) and Agitococcus with QIIME1 or QIIME2 (2 or 3% abundance, respectively), but both genera remained undetected when analyzed with Mothur or MEGAN. Since these abundant taxa probably have implications for important biogeochemical cycles (e.g., nitrate and sulfate reduction) at these sites, their detection and semi-quantitative enumeration is crucial for valid interpretations. A high-performance computing conformant workflow was constructed to allow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable) 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequence analysis starting from raw sequence files, using the most optimal methods identified in our study. Our presented workflow should be considered for future studies, thereby facilitating the analysis of high-throughput 16S rRNA (gene) sequencing data substantially, while maximizing reliability and confidence in microbial community data analysis.},

abstract = {Background In recent years, the microbiome field has undergone a shift from clustering-based methods of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) designation based on sequence similarity to denoising algorithms that identify exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and methods to identify contaminating bacterial DNA sequences from low biomass samples have been developed. Although these methods improve accuracy when analyzing mock communities, their impact on real samples and downstream analysis of biological associations is less clear. Results Here, we re-processed our recently published milk microbiota data using Qiime1 to identify OTUs, and Qiime2 to identify ASVs, with or without contaminant removal using decontam. Qiime2 resolved the mock community more accurately, primarily because Qiime1 failed to detect Lactobacillus . Qiime2 also considerably reduced the average number of ASVs detected in human milk samples (364 ± 145 OTUs vs. 170 ± 73 ASVs, p  < 0.001). Compared to the richness, the estimated diversity measures had a similar range using both methods albeit statistically different (inverse Simpson index: 14.3 ± 8.5 vs. 15.6 ± 8.7, p  = 0.031) and there was strong consistency and agreement for the relative abundances of the most abundant bacterial taxa, including Staphylococcaceae and Streptococcaceae . One notable exception was Oxalobacteriaceae , which was overrepresented using Qiime1 regardless of contaminant removal. Downstream statistical analyses were not impacted by the choice of algorithm in terms of the direction, strength, and significance of associations of host factors with bacterial diversity and overall community composition. Conclusion Overall, the biological observations and conclusions were robust to the choice of the sequencing processing methods and contaminant removal.},

abstract = {Background Taxonomic classification of genetic markers for microbiome analysis is affected by the numerous choices made from sample preparation to bioinformatics analysis. Paired-end read merging is routinely used to capture the entire amplicon sequence when the read ends overlap. However, the exclusion of unmerged reads from further analysis can result in underestimating the diversity in the sequenced microbial community and is influenced by bioinformatic processes such as read trimming and the choice of reference database. A potential solution to overcome this is to concatenate (join) reads that do not overlap and keep them for taxonomic classification. The use of concatenated reads can outperform taxonomic recovery from single-end reads, but it remains unclear how their performance compares to merged reads. Using various sequenced mock communities with different amplicons, read length, read depth, taxonomic composition, and sequence quality, we tested how merging and concatenating reads performed for genus recall and precision in bioinformatic pipelines combining different parameters for read trimming and taxonomic classification using different reference databases. Results The addition of concatenated reads to merged reads always increased pipeline performance. The top two performing pipelines both included read concatenation, with variable strengths depending on the mock community. The pipeline that combined merged and concatenated reads that were quality-trimmed performed best for mock communities with larger amplicons and higher average quality sequences. The pipeline that used length-trimmed concatenated reads outperformed quality trimming in mock communities with lower quality sequences but lost a significant amount of input sequences for taxonomic classification during processing. Genus level classification was more accurate using the SILVA reference database compared to Greengenes. Conclusions Merged sequences with the addition of concatenated sequences that were unable to be merged increased performance of taxonomic classifications. This was especially beneficial in mock communities with larger amplicons. We have shown for the first time, using an in-depth comparison of pipelines containing merged vs concatenated reads combined with different trimming parameters and reference databases, the potential advantages of concatenating sequences in improving resolution in microbiome investigations.},

abstract = {Abstract Metabarcoding studies provide a powerful approach to estimate the diversity and abundance of organisms in mixed communities in nature. While strategies exist for optimizing sample and sequence library preparation, best practices for bioinformatic processing of amplicon sequence data are lacking in animal diet studies. Here we evaluate how decisions made in core bioinformatic processes, including sequence filtering, database design, and classification, can influence animal metabarcoding results. We show that denoising methods have lower error rates compared to traditional clustering methods, although these differences are largely mitigated by removing low‐abundance sequence variants. We also found that available reference datasets from GenBank and BOLD for the animal marker gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) can be complementary, and we discuss methods to improve existing databases to include versioned releases. Taxonomic classification methods can dramatically affect results. For example, the commonly used Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) Classification API assigned fewer names to samples from order through species levels using both a mock community and bat guano samples compared to all other classifiers (vsearch‐SINTAX and q2‐feature‐classifier's BLAST + LCA, VSEARCH + LCA, and Naive Bayes classifiers). The lack of consensus on bioinformatics best practices limits comparisons among studies and may introduce biases. Our work suggests that biological mock communities offer a useful standard to evaluate the myriad computational decisions impacting animal metabarcoding accuracy. Further, these comparisons highlight the need for continual evaluations as new tools are adopted to ensure that the inferences drawn reflect meaningful biology instead of digital artifacts.},

abstract = {Microbial communities have important ramifications for human health, but determining their impact requires accurate characterization. Current technology makes microbiome sequence data more accessible than ever. However, popular software methods for analyzing these data are based on algorithms developed alongside older sequencing technology and smaller data sets and thus may not be adequate for modern, high-throughput data sets. Additionally, samples from environments where microbes are scarce present additional challenges to community characterization relative to high-biomass environments, an issue that is often ignored. We found that a new class of microbiome sequence processing tools, called amplicon sequence variant (ASV) methods, outperformed conventional methods. In samples representing low-biomass communities, where sample contamination becomes a significant confounding factor, the improved accuracy of ASV methods may allow more-robust computational identification of contaminants. ABSTRACT Microbiome community composition plays an important role in human health, and while most research to date has focused on high-microbial-biomass communities, low-biomass communities are also important. However, contamination and technical noise make determining the true community signal difficult when biomass levels are low, and the influence of varying biomass on sequence processing methods has received little attention. Here, we benchmarked six methods that infer community composition from 16S rRNA sequence reads, using samples of varying biomass. We included two operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering algorithms, one entropy-based method, and three more-recent amplicon sequence variant (ASV) methods. We first compared inference results from high-biomass mock communities to assess baseline performance. We then benchmarked the methods on a dilution series made from a single mock community—samples that varied only in biomass. ASVs/OTUs inferred by each method were classified as representing expected community, technical noise, or contamination. With the high-biomass data, we found that the ASV methods had good sensitivity and precision, whereas the other methods suffered in one area or in both. Inferred contamination was present only in small proportions. With the dilution series, contamination represented an increasing proportion of the data from the inferred communities, regardless of the inference method used. However, correlation between inferred contaminants and sample biomass was strongest for the ASV methods and weakest for the OTU methods. Thus, no inference method on its own can distinguish true community sequences from contaminant sequences, but ASV methods provide the most accurate characterization of community and contaminants. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities have important ramifications for human health, but determining their impact requires accurate characterization.

Different bioinformatics pipelines can be used to convert 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing data into an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) table that is used to analyze microbial communities. It is important to assess the robustness of these pipelines, each with specific algorithms and/or parameters, and their influence on the outcome of statistical tests. Articles with publicly available datasets on the oral microbiome were searched for, and five datasets were retrieved. These were from studies on changes in microbiota related to smoking, oral cancer, caries, diabetes, or periodontitis. Next, the data was processed with four pipelines based on VSEARCH, USEARCH, mothur, and UNOISE3. OTU tables were rarefied, and differences in α-diversity and β-diversity were tested for different groups in a dataset. Finally, these results were checked for consistency among these example pipelines. Of articles that deposited data, only 57% made all sequencing and metadata available. When processing the datasets, issues were encountered, caused by read characteristics and differences between tools and their defaults in combination with a lack of detail in the methodology of the articles. In general, the four mainstream pipelines provided similar results, but importantly, P-values sometimes differed between pipelines beyond the significance threshold. Our results indicated that for published articles, the description of bioinformatics methods and data deposition should be improved, and regarding reproducibility, that analysis of multiple subsamples is required when using rarefying as library-size normalization method.},

abstract = {NG-Tax 2.0 is a semantic framework for FAIR high-throughput analysis and classification of marker gene amplicon sequences including bacterial and archaeal 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), eukaryotic 18S rRNA and ribosomal intergenic transcribed spacer sequences. It can directly use single or merged reads, paired-end reads and unmerged paired-end reads from long range fragments as input to generate de novo amplicon sequence variants (ASV). Using the RDF data model, ASV’s can be automatically stored in a graph database as objects that link ASV sequences with the full data-wise and element-wise provenance, thereby achieving the level of interoperability required to utilize such data to its full potential. The graph database can be directly queried, allowing for comparative analyses of over thousands of samples and is connected with an interactive Rshiny toolbox for analysis and visualization of (meta) data. Additionally, NG-Tax 2.0 exports an extended BIOM 1.0 (JSON) file as starting point for further analyses by other means. The extended BIOM file contains new attribute types to include information about the command arguments used, the sequences of the ASVs formed, classification confidence scores and is backwards compatible. The performance of NG-Tax 2.0 was compared with DADA2, using the plugin in the QIIME 2 analysis pipeline. Fourteen 16S rRNA gene amplicon mock community samples were obtained from the literature and evaluated. Precision of NG-Tax 2.0 was significantly higher with an average of 0.95 vs 0.58 for QIIME2-DADA2 while recall was comparable with an average of 0.85 and 0.77, respectively. NG-Tax 2.0 is written in Java.

The relatve scarcity of microbes in low biomass communites makes an accurate determinaton of community compositon challenging, since contaminaton and technical noise may confound the true community signal when biomass is very low. However, the impact of these noise sources on microbial community inference is not well studied. The most common techni-ue for estmatng community compositon is to se-uence the 16S rRNA genes, which serve as phylogenetc barcodes for prokaryotes, in a sample. True community se-uences, and hence compositon, are then inferred from the noisy se-uence data. OTU clustering algorithms have been the de facto standard for in silico community inference from 16S rRNA se-uence data, but recently, several algorithms have emerged that use se-uencer error models to improve inference.

abstract = {The bacterial composition of oral samples has traditionally been determined by PCR amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Recent amplicon sequence variant (ASV)based analyses of 16S rRNA genes differ from that based on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering in the way it deals with sequences having potential errors. However, little information is available on its application in oral microbiome studies. Here, we conducted ASV-based analysis of oral microbiome samples using QIIME 2. We investigated the optimal parameters for sequence denoising, using DADA2, and found the trimming of the first 20 nucleotides from 5′-end of both paired reads avoided excessive sequence loss during chimera removal. Truncating reads at positions 240–245 allowed the removal of low-quality sequences while maintaining sufficient length to merge matching paired ends. Taxonomic assignment, using the naïve Bayes classifier trained with the V3-V4 region of reference 16S rRNA sequences in the extended human oral microbiome database (eHOMD), resulted in bacterial compositions similar to those of OTU-based analyses. Contrary to OTU-based clustering, ASV-based analysis showed taxonomic abundance at the genus or species level to not differ significantly in tongue microbiomes, regardless of brushing. QIIME 2 can, therefore, be a standard pipeline for ASV-based analysis of oral microbiomes.},

Our pipeline allows customizing the analyses by offering several choices for most of the steps, for example different OTU generating methods. The pipeline can make use of multiple computing nodes and scales from personal computers to computing servers.

abstract = {This in silico investigation aimed to: 1) evaluate a set of primer pairs with high coverage, including those most commonly used in the literature, to find the different oral species with 16S rRNA gene amplicon similarity/identity (ASI) values ≥97%; and 2) identify oral species that may be erroneously clustered in the same operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and ascertain whether they belong to distinct genera or other higher taxonomic ranks. Thirty-nine primer pairs were employed to obtain amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from the complete genomes of 186 bacterial and 135 archaeal species. For each primer, ASVs without mismatches were aligned using BLASTN and their similarity values were obtained. Finally, we selected ASVs from different species with an ASI value ≥97% that were covered 100% by the query sequences. For each primer, the percentage of species-level coverage with no ASI≥97% (SC-NASI≥97%) was calculated. Based on the SC-NASI≥97% values, the best primer pairs were OP_F053-KP_R020 for bacteria (65.05%), KP_F018-KP_R002 for archaea (51.11%), and OP_F114-KP_R031 for bacteria and archaea together (52.02%). Eighty percent of the oral-bacteria and oralarchaea species shared an ASI≥97% with at least one other taxa, including Campylobacter, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Tannerella, which played conflicting roles in the oral microbiota. Moreover, around a quarter and a third of these two-by-two similarity relationships were between species from different bacteria and archaea genera, respectively. Furthermore, even taxa from distinct families, orders, and classes could be grouped in the same cluster. Consequently, irrespective of the primer pair used, OTUs constructed with a 97% similarity provide an inaccurate description of oral-bacterial and oral-archaeal species, greatly affecting microbial diversity parameters. As a result, clustering by OTUs impacts the credibility of the associations between some oral species and certain health and disease conditions. This limits significantly the comparability of the microbial diversity findings reported in oral microbiome literature.},

Previous studies have found that the endolithic microbial composition of a single coral species can be biogeographical diverse. However, the potential environmental factors, such as salinity, temperature, pH, and nutrient, that might influence the composition of the endolithic microbes remain unclear. In this study, we used both amplicon sequence variants (ASV) and a kmer-based taxonomic unit (KTU) to characterize the endolithic bacterial constitution of Isopora spp. located in the western Pacific Ocean—where it is subjected to the Kuroshio Current (in Okinawa, Japan and Green Island, Taiwan)—and the South China Sea (Dongsha Atoll). The endolithic bacterial community compositions showed a significant geographical difference, and we suggest that the ocean current and primary productivity are the most essential environmental factors influencing the bacterial communities in the skeleton of Isopora spp. In addition, our results showed that, technically, compared to ASV, bacterial composition based on KTU avoids extreme data, making it a suitable tool for explaining the associations between microbes and environmental factors.},

ABSTRACT Recent discussion focuses on the best method for delineating microbial taxa, based on either exact sequence variants (ESVs) or traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of marker gene sequences. We sought to test if the binning approach (ESVs versus 97% OTUs) affected the ecological conclusions of a large field study. The data set included sequences targeting all bacteria (16S rRNA) and fungi (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), across multiple environments diverging markedly in abiotic conditions, over three collection times. Despite quantitative differences in microbial richness, we found that all α and β diversity metrics were highly positively correlated (r > 0.90) between samples analyzed with both approaches. Moreover, the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches. Consequently, statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable. Furthermore, ESVs only moderately increased the genetic resolution of fungal and bacterial diversity (1.3 and 2.1 times OTU richness, respectively). We conclude that for broadscale (e.g., all bacteria or all fungi) α and β diversity analyses, ESV or OTU methods will often reveal similar ecological results. Thus, while there are good reasons to employ ESVs, we need not question the validity of results based on OTUs.
