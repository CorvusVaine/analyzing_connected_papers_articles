abstract = {Deep Learning is a branch of Machine Learning, which focuses on a set of algorithms that model high-level abstractions in data by using a deep representation of multiple processing layers. The goal of Machine Learning is to map input patterns to output values. This paper will suggest a potential application of Deep Learning Algorithms for the analysis of large amounts of data produced by the research of the Human Microbiome. Humans have coevolved with microbes in the environment, and each body habitat has a unique set of microorganisms (microbiota). The most abundant and well-studied microbiota are found in the gut, where the bacterial density reaches 1011–1012 cells/g in the distal human colon. The number of bacteria in the human gut has been estimated to exceed the number of somatic cells in the body by an order of magnitude and that the biomass of the gut microbiota may reach up to 1.5 kg. This paper presents different methods that have been implemented and tested on a Human Microbiome Dataset. Besides the findings concerning accuracy and runtime, the results suggest that the Deep Learning algorithms could be successfully used to analyze large amounts of Microbiota data.},

abstract = {Objective To characterise the gut microbiome in subjects with and without polyps and evaluate the potential of the microbiome as a non-invasive biomarker to screen for risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Design Presurgery rectal swab, home collected stool, and sigmoid biopsy samples were obtained from 231 subjects undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy. 16S rRNA analysis was performed on 552 samples (231 rectal swab, 183 stool, 138 biopsy) and operational taxonomic units (OTU) were identified using UPARSE. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to identify OTUs that were significantly different between subjects with and without polyps. These informative OTUs were then used to build classifiers to predict the presence of polyps using advanced machine learning models. Results We obtained clinical data on 218 subjects (87 females, 131 males) of which 193 were White, 21 African-American, and 4 Asian-American. Colonoscopy detected polyps in 56% of subjects. Modelling of the non-invasive home stool samples resulted in a classification accuracy >75% for Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models using informative OTUs. A naïve holdout analysis performed on home stool samples resulted in an average false negative rate of 11.5% for the Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models, which was reduced to 5% when the two models were combined. Conclusion Gut microbiome analysis combined with advanced machine learning represents a promising approach to screen patients for the presence of polyps, with the potential to optimise the use of colonoscopy, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with CRC, and reduce associated healthcare costs.},

abstract = {Automated detection and segmentation of histologic primitives are critical steps for developing computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis system on histopathological tissue specimens. For a number of cancers, the clinical cancer grading system is highly correlated with the pathomic features of histologic primitives that appreciated from histopathological images. However, automated detection and segmentation of histologic primitives is pretty challenged because of the complicity and high density of histologic data. Therefore, there is a high demand for developing intelligent and computational image analysis tools for digital pathology images. Recently there have been interests in the application of “Deep Learning” strategies for classification and analysis of big image data. Histopathology, given its size and complexity, represents an excellent use case for application of deep learning strategies. In this chapter, we present deep learning based approaches for two challenged tasks in histological image analysis: (1) Automated nuclear atypia scoring (NAS) on breast histopathology. We present a Multi-Resolution Convolutional Network (MR-CN) with Plurality Voting (MR-CN-PV) model for automated NAS. MR-CN-PV consists of three Single-Resolution Convolutional Network (SR-CN) with Majority Voting (SR-CN-MV) model for getting independent NAS. MR-CN-PV combines three scores via plurality voting for getting final score. (2) Epithelial (EP) and stromal (ST) tissues discrimination. The work utilized a pixel-wise Convolutional Network (CN-PI) based segmentation model for automated EP and ST tissues discrimination. We present experiments on two challenged datasets. For automated NAS, the MR-CN-PV model was evaluated on MITOS-ATYPIA-14 Challenge dataset. MR-CN-PV model got 67 score which was placed the second comparing with the scores of other five teams. The proposed CN-PI model outperformed patch-wise CN (CN-PA) models in discriminating EP and ST tissues on a breast histological images.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT An increasing body of literature suggests that both individual and collections of bacteria are associated with the progression of colorectal cancer. As the number of studies investigating these associations increases and the number of subjects in each study increases, a meta-analysis to identify the associations that are the most predictive of disease progression is warranted. We analyzed previously published 16S rRNA gene sequencing data collected from feces and colon tissue. We quantified the odds ratios (ORs) for individual bacterial taxa that were associated with an individual having tumors relative to a normal colon. Among the fecal samples, there were no taxa that had significant ORs associated with adenoma and there were 8 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Similarly, among the tissue samples, there were no taxa that had a significant OR associated with adenoma and there were 3 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Among the significant ORs, the association between individual taxa and tumor diagnosis was equal to or below 7.11. Because individual taxa had limited association with tumor diagnosis, we trained Random Forest classification models using only the taxa that had significant ORs, using the entire collection of taxa found in each study, and using operational taxonomic units defined based on a 97% similarity threshold. All training approaches yielded similar classification success as measured using the area under the curve. The ability to correctly classify individuals with adenomas was poor, and the ability to classify individuals with carcinomas was considerably better using sequences from feces or tissue. IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is a significant and growing health problem in which animal models and epidemiological data suggest that the colonic microbiota have a role in tumorigenesis. These observations indicate that the colonic microbiota is a reservoir of biomarkers that may improve our ability to detect colonic tumors using noninvasive approaches. This meta-analysis identifies and validates a set of 8 bacterial taxa that can be used within a Random Forest modeling framework to differentiate individuals as having normal colons or carcinomas. When models trained using one data set were tested on other data sets, the models performed well. These results lend support to the use of fecal biomarkers for the detection of tumors. Furthermore, these biomarkers are plausible candidates for further mechanistic studies into the role of the gut microbiota in tumorigenesis.

abstract = {Considering that colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer-related cause of death within the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal SCFA concentrations of a cohort of individuals with different colonic tumor burdens who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between SCFA concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and SCFA concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak. ABSTRACT Colonic bacterial populations are thought to have a role in the development of colorectal cancer with some protecting against inflammation and others exacerbating inflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by colonic bacteria that produce SCFAs by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an association between fecal SCFA concentrations and the presence of colonic adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no significant associations between SCFA concentration and tumor status. When we incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models trained to differentiate between people with healthy colons and those with adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the ability of 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to predict the concentration of each SCFA based on 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able to explain at most 14% of the observed variation in the SCFA concentrations. These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal cancer. Although other bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, fecal SCFA concentrations have limited predictive power.

In this paper, we follow the deep incremental learning framework and propose a prediction model of breast cancer malignancy by incremental combination of multiple recurrent neural networks. Specially, the model first uses multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for generating features from the multi-types of clinical text including B-ultrasound, X-rays, Computed Tomography (CT), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and then combines the generated features in an incremental way. Finally, we add one more recurrent neural network layer for classifying benign and malignant of breast cancer based on combined generated features.},

With the purpose of illustrating the applicability and efficiency of the method proposed here, we use four different gene expression microarray databases and compare their classification performance against that of other renowned classifiers built on the whole (original) feature (gene) space. The experimental results show that the two-stage hetero-associative memory is quite competitive with standard classification models regarding the overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. In addition, it also produces a significant decrease in computational efforts and an increase in the biological interpretability of microarrays because worthless (irrelevant and/or redundant) genes are discarded.},

abstract = {The human microbiome is a fundamental component of human physiology, with an estimated one-third of circulating metabolites being a product of the gut microbiota. Changes in the microbiome can trigger changes in human cellular activities, resulting in disease or contribute to its progression. Microbiota is considered to be a virtual "code" or a system emerging, with the properties that must be integrated into the biology and physiology of the human. Unlike the other components, the functions of this "code" are not yet fully understood but can be quite easily disturbed by diet, diseases, and the various treatments. Recently, it becomes more and more clear that these functions can be beneficial both and with the negative impact on the health status of the human host. The recognition of the role of soil microflora in the intestinal diseases and neurological or in metabolic diseases of systemic triggered an avalanche of studies which also were aimed at the elucidation of the human microbiome (Human Microbiome Project), but also a complicated interaction between the bi-directional relationship between the human and the intestinal bacteria.

In this work, we aim at analyzing the performance of deep neural networks for classification of gene-expression microarrays, in which the number of genes is of the order of thousands while the number of samples is typically less than a hundred. The experimental results show that in some of these challenging situations, the use of deep neural networks and traditional machine learning algorithms does not always lead to high performance results.

The proposed method specifies the candidate prognostic gene module by graph learning using the generative adversarial networks (GANs) model, and scores genes using a PageRank algorithm. We applied the proposed method to multiple-omics data that included copy number, gene expression, DNA methylation, and somatic mutation data for five cancer types. The proposed method showed better prediction accuracy than did existing methods. We identified many prognostic genes and their roles in their biological pathways. We also showed that the genes identified from different omics data were complementary, which led to improved accuracy in prediction using multi-omics data.},

abstract = {Scoring the size/shape variations of cancer nuclei nuclear pleomorphism in breast cancer histopathology images is a critical prog-nostic marker in breast cancer grading and has been subject to a con-siderable amount of observer variability and subjectivity issues. In spite of a decade long histopathology image analysis research, automated as-sessment of nuclear pleomorphism remains challenging due to the com-plex visual appearance and huge variability of cancer nuclei.This study proposes a practical application of the deep belief based deep neural net-work DBN-DNN model to determine the nuclear pleomorphism score of breast cancer tissue. The DBN-DNN network is trained to classify a breast cancer histology image into one of the three groups: score 1, score 2 and score 3 nuclear pleomorphism by learning the mean and standard deviation of morphological and texture features of the entire nuclei population contained in a breast histology image. The model was trained for features from automatically-segmented nuclei from 80 breast cancer histopathology images selected from publicly available MITOS-ATYPIA dataset. The classification accuracy of the model on the training and testing datasets was found to be 96i¾?% and 90i¾?% respectively.},

abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a highly specialized sensory organ that provides crucial negative feedback during a meal, partly via a gut–brain axis. More specifically, enteroendocrine cells located throughout the GI tract are able to sense and respond to specific nutrients, releasing gut peptides that act in a paracrine, autocrine or endocrine fashion to regulate energy balance, thus controlling both food intake and possibly energy expenditure. Furthermore, the gut microbiota has been shown to provide a substantial metabolic and physiological contribution to the host, and metabolic disease such as obesity has been associated with aberrant gut microbiota and microbiome. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota can impact the gut–brain axis controlling energy balance, at both the level of intestinal nutrient‐sensing mechanisms, as well as potentially at the sites of integration in the central nervous system. A better understanding of the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and host energy‐regulating pathways is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms responsible for the development of metabolic diseases and for possible therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Precise breast cancer classification can aid the clinicians in making decision of diagnosis and therapy. The existing works mainly utilized medical images for breast cancer classification, ignoring the value of Electronic Medical Records (EMR). In this study, we investigate the problem of breast cancer classification with EMR data and propose a new breast cancer classification model based on Hierarchical Attention Bidirectional Networks (HA-BiRNN). Our proposed model supports the integration of the features of the diagnosis reports with the features of the context information in EMR. Specially, our proposed model first uses three HA-BiRNNs to extract features from one type of report in a hierarchical way. In each HA-BiRNN, a hierarchical neural network structure, consisting in two encoder layers of BiRNN (Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks), mirrors the hierarchical structure of diagnosis reports, and a hierarchical attention mechanism, consisting of two level attentions, attends to important elements within diagnosis report with word-level attention and sentence-level attention. Secondly, to learn the feature of context information, our proposed model uses two additional BiRNNs. Finally, we add one more recurrent neural network layer for classifying breast cancer based on patients’ features generated by combing the reports’ vectors. We evaluate our method on the real world breast cancer clinical reports, and results show that our method achieves higher performance on breast cancer classification.},

Here, we demonstrate a successful report on a deep learning-based item categorization method, i.e., deep categorization network (DeepCN), in an e-commerce website. DeepCN is an end-to-end model using multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) dedicated to metadata attributes for generating features from text metadata and fully connected layers for classifying item categories from the generated features. The categorization errors are propagated back through the fully connected layers to the RNNs for weight update in the learning process. This deep learning-based approach allows diverse attributes to be integrated into a common representation, thus overcoming sparsity and scalability problems. We evaluate DeepCN on large-scale real-world data including more than 94 million items with approximately 4,100 leaf categories from a Korean e-commerce website. Experiment results show our method improves the categorization accuracy compared to the model using single RNN as well as a standard classification model using unigram-based bag-of-words. Furthermore, we investigate how much the model parameters and the used attributes influence categorization performances.},

abstract = {Nuclear pleomorphism has been recognized as a key histological criterium in breast cancer grading systems (such as Bloom Richardson and Nothingham grading systems). However, the nuclear pleomorphism assessment is subjective and presents high inter-reader variability. Automatic algorithms might facilitate quantitative estimation of nuclear variations in shape and size. Nevertheless, the automatic segmentation of the nuclei is difficult and still and open research problem. This paper presents a method using a bag of multi-scale visual features, modulated by a graph structure, to grade nuclei in breast cancer microscopical fields. This strategy constructs hematoxylin-eosin image patches, each containing a nucleus that is represented by a set of visual words in the BoF. The contribution of each visual word is computed by examining the visual words in an associated graph built when projecting the multi-dimensional BoF to a bi-dimensional plane where local relationships are conserved. The methodology was evaluated using 14 breast cancer cases of the Cancer Genome Atlas database. From these cases, a set of 134 microscopical fields was extracted, and under a leave-one-out validation scheme, an average F-score of 0.68 was obtained.},

The method is based on the region covariance descriptor that has recently become a popular method in various computer vision applications. The descriptor in its original form is not suitable for classification of histopathology images as cancerous histopathology images tend to possess diversely heterogeneous regions in a single field of view. Our proposed image-level descriptor, which we term as the geodesic mean of region covariance descriptors, possesses all the attractive properties of covariance descriptors lending itself to tractable geodesic-distance-based k-nearest neighbor classification using efficient kernels.

Research involving the ranking by several experts shows that kappa coefficient ranges from 0.3(low) to 0.5 (moderate)[12].

First, a large nuclei sample is characterized by a multi-scale descriptor that is then assigned to the most similar atom of a previously learned dictionary. An occurrence histogram represents then any Field of View (FoV) in terms of the occurrence of the descriptors with respect to the learned atoms of the dictionary. Finally, a SVM classifier assigns a full pleomorphism grading, between 1 and 3, using the previous histogram. The strategy was evaluated extracting 134 FoV (\(\times 20\)), graded by a pathologist, from 14 BCa slides of ’The Cancer Genome Atlas’ (TCGA) database.The obtained precision and recall measures were 0.67 and 0.67.},

abstract = {Inter-pathologist agreement for nuclear atypia scoring of breast cancer is poor. To address this problem, previous studies suggested some criteria for describing the variations appearance of tumor cells relative to normal cells. However, these criteria were still assessed subjectively by pathologists. Previous studies used quantitative computer-extracted features for scoring. However, application of these tools is limited as further improvement in their accuracy is required. This study proposes COMPASS (COMputer-assisted analysis combined with Pathologist’s ASSessment) for reproducible nuclear atypia scoring. COMPASS relies on both cytological criteria assessed subjectively by pathologists as well as computer-extracted textural features. Using machine learning, COMPASS combines these two sets of features and output nuclear atypia score. COMPASS’s performance was evaluated using 300 images for which expert-consensus derived reference nuclear pleomorphism scores were available, and they were scanned by two scanners from different vendors. A personalized model was built for three pathologists who gave scores to six atypia-related criteria for each image. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used. COMPASS was trained and tested for each pathologist separately. Percentage agreement between COMPASS and the reference nuclear scores was 93.8%, 92.9%, and 93.1% for three pathologists. COMPASS’s performance in nuclear grading was almost identical for both scanners, with Cohen’s kappa ranging from 0.80 to 0.86 for different pathologists and different scanners. Independently, the images were also assessed by two experienced senior pathologists. Cohen’s kappa of COMPASS was comparable to the Cohen’s kappa for two senior pathologists (0.79 and 0.68).},

abstract = {The process of Nuclei detection in high-grade breast cancer images is quite challenging in the case of image processing techniques due to certain heterogeneous characteristics of cancer nuclei such as enlarged and irregularly shaped nuclei, highly coarse chromatin marginalized to the nuclei periphery and visible nucleoli. Recent reviews state that existing techniques show appreciable segmentation accuracy on breast histopathology images whose nuclei are dispersed and regular in texture and shape; however, typical cancer nuclei are often clustered and have irregular texture and shape properties. This paper proposes a novel segmentation algorithm for detecting individual nuclei from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained breast histopathology images. This detection framework estimates a nuclei saliency map using tensor voting followed by boundary extraction of the nuclei on the saliency map using a Loopy Back Propagation (LBP) algorithm on a Markov Random Field (MRF). The method was tested on both whole-slide images and frames of breast cancer histopathology images. Experimental results demonstrate high segmentation performance with efficient precision, recall and dice-coefficient rates, upon testing high-grade breast cancer images containing several thousand nuclei. In addition to the optimal performance on the highly complex images presented in this paper, this method also gave appreciable results in comparison with two recently published methods—Wienert et al. (2012) and Veta et al. (2013), which were tested using their own datasets.},

It relies highly on the experience of the pathologists. In a large hospital, one pathologist may have to evaluate more than a hundred cases per day, which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. Thus, it is necessary to develop an automatic system to support the pathologists.This paper proposes a method that automatically selects and segments critical cell nuclei within a high-resolution histopathological image for nuclear pleomorphism scoring according to the Nottingham grading system. In contrast, most of the existing methods tend to detect all the cells in an image which is computationally expensive. Comprehensive experiments show that accurate scoring can be achieved by segmenting only critical cells, thus reducing the execution time of the method.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is found to be the most pervasive type of cancer among women. Computer aided detection and diagnosis of cancer at the initial stages can increase the chances of recovery and thus reduce the mortality rate through timely prognosis and adequate treatment planning. The nuclear atypia scoring or histopathological breast tumor grading remains to be a challenging problem due to the various artifacts and variabilities introduced during slide preparation and also because of the complexity in the structure of the underlying tissue patterns. Inspired by the success of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices in many of the challenging tasks in machine learning and computer vision, a sparse coding and dictionary learning on SPD matrices is proposed in this paper for the breast tumor grading. The proposed covariance-based SPD matrices form a Riemannian manifold and are represented as the sparse combination of Riemannian dictionary atoms. Non-linearity of the SPD manifold is tackled by embedding into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space using kernels derived from log-Euclidean metric, Jeffrey and Stein divergences and compared with the non-kernel-based affine invariant Riemannian metric. The novelty of the work lies in exploiting the kernel approach for the Hilbert space embedding of the Riemannian manifold, that can achieve a better discrimination of the breast cancer tissues, following a sparse representation over learned dictionaries and henceforth it outperforms many of the state-of-the-art algorithms in breast cancer grading in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis.},

abstract = {Technological advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and chromatographic assays [e.g., liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)] have made it possible to identify thousands of microbe and metabolite species, and to measure their relative abundance. In this paper, we propose a sparse neural encoder-decoder network to predict metabolite abundances from microbe abundances. Using paired data from a cohort of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, we show that our neural encoder-decoder model outperforms linear univariate and multivariate methods in terms of accuracy, sparsity, and stability. Importantly, we show that our neural encoder-decoder model is not simply a black box designed to maximize predictive accuracy. Rather, the network’s hidden layer (i.e., the latent space, comprised only of sparsely weighted microbe counts) actually captures key microbe-metabolite relationships that are themselves clinically meaningful. Although this hidden layer is learned without any knowledge of the patient’s diagnosis, we show that the learned latent features are structured in a way that predicts IBD and treatment status with high accuracy. By imposing a non-negative weights constraint, the network becomes a directed graph where each downstream node is interpretable as the additive combination of the upstream nodes. Here, the middle layer comprises distinct microbe-metabolite axes that relate key microbial biomarkers with metabolite biomarkers. By pre-processing the microbiome and metabolome data using compositional data analysis methods, we ensure that our proposed multi-omics workflow will generalize to any pair of -omics data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first application of neural encoder-decoders for the interpretable integration of multi-omics biological data.},

abstract = {Recently, Quinn and Erb et al [1] made the case that when used correctly, correlation and proportionality can outperform MMvec when identifying microbe-metabolite interactions. We revisit this comparison and show that the proposed correlation and proportionality are outperformed by MMvec on real data due to their inability to deal with sparsity commonly observed in microbiome and metabolome datasets.},
