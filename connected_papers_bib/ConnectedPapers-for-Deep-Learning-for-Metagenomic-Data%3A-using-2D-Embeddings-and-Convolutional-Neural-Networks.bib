abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have had unprecedented success when applied to images, waveforms, and texts to cite a few. In general, when the sample size (N) is much greater than the number of features (d), DL outperforms previous machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of convolution neural networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics ML tasks, we encounter the opposite situation where d is greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques (such as feed-forward networks) would lead to severe overfitting. Thus, sparse ML techniques (such as LASSO e.g.) usually yield the best results on these tasks. In this paper, we show how to apply CNNs on data which do not have originally an image structure (in particular on metagenomic data). Our first contribution is to show how to map metagenomic data in a meaningful way to 1D or 2D images. Based on this representation, we then apply a CNN, with the aim of predicting various diseases. The proposed approach is applied on six different datasets including in total over 1000 samples from various diseases. This approach could be a promising one for prediction tasks in the bioinformatics field.},

abstract = {Scientific research is shedding more and more light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human body and its role in human health. Empirical evidence shows that the microbiome is strongly interconnected with the host immune system and can contribute to carcinogenesis. Furthermore, studies show that it can be used as a predictor for various diseases. In this work, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. Adopting an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks, MVIB allows to compute a joint stochastic encoding of the input data modalities, which acts as a minimal sufficient statistics of the inputs for the prediction of a target label. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA. Additionally, we perform transfer learning experiments by fine-tuning the model on the target disease dataset after a pre-training on all other source diseases, as well as cross-study generalisation experiments. Furthermore, we adopt a saliency technique to interpret the outcome of the model classification and identify which microbial species and strain-level markers mostly contribute to a certain prediction. The combination of metabolomic data to the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles is also investigated. We show that MVIB achieves competitive results on the microbiome-based disease prediction task and is very fast to train. Author summary The gut microbiome is strongly correlated with human health and can be used to predict various diseases. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning method which allows to efficiently combine heterogeneous data modalities by computing a joint stochastic encoding. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease and we shed light on which microbial species and gene markers contribute significantly to the prediction outcome. Specifically, we analyse species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA from ten different cohorts and obtain competitive classification performance on disease prediction. Furthermore, we adopt a method based on saliency to discover which microbial species and gene markers mostly contribute to the model prediction. Additionally, we perform experiments combining abundance and marker profiles with metabolomic data extracted from mass spectrometry. We show that MVIB can operate accurate microbiome-based disease prediction and is also very fast to train.},

abstract = {The recent advent of Metagenome Wide Association Studies (MGWAS) provides insight into the role of microbes on human health and disease. However, the studies present several computational challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel, efficient, and effective Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) based computational pipeline to predict patient phenotype from metagenomic data. MIL methods have the advantage that besides predicting the clinical phenotype, we can infer the instance level label or role of microbial sequence reads in the specific disease. Specifically, we use a Bag of Words method, which has been shown to be one of the most effective and efficient MIL methods. This involves assembly of the metagenomic sequence data, clustering of the assembled contigs, extracting features from the contigs, and using an SVM classifier to predict patient labels and identify the most relevant sequence clusters. With the exception of the given labels for the patients, this entire process is de novo (unsupervised). We call our pipeline “CAMIL”, which stands for Clustering and Assembly with Multiple Instance Learning. We use multiple state-of-the-art clustering methods for feature extraction, evaluation, and comparison of the performance of our proposed approach for each of these clustering methods. We also present a fast and scalable pre-clustering algorithm as a preprocessing step for our proposed pipeline. Our approach achieves efficiency by partitioning the large number of sequence reads into groups (called canopies) using locality sensitive hashing (LSH). These canopies are then refined by using state-of-the-art sequence clustering algorithms. We use data from a well-known MGWAS study of patients with Type-2 Diabetes and show that our pipeline significantly outperforms the classifier used in that paper, as well as other common MIL methods.},

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.},

Conditional generative adversarial networks train two models against each other while leveraging side information learn from a given dataset to compute larger simulated datasets that are representative of the original dataset.

Methods: Forty insulin-dependent diabetic patients, 40 diabetic patients who were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents and 40 healthy people were recruited based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and they were evaluated for lipid profile, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and Akkermansia muciniphila bacterium. Results: The majority of all study subjects were women, non-smokers with more than four hours activity a day. They were not different in terms of demographic characteristics. FBS level was significantly higher in subjects with type 2 diabetes than in healthy subjects (P <0.001) with no significant difference in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

abstract = {Abstract Motivation The human body hosts more microbial organisms than human cells. Analysis of this microbial diversity provides key insight into the role played by these microorganisms on human health. Metagenomics is the collective DNA sequencing of coexisting microbial organisms in an environmental sample or a host. This has several applications in precision medicine, agriculture, environmental science and forensics. State-of-the-art predictive models for phenotype predictions from metagenomic data rely on alignments, assembly, extensive pruning, taxonomic profiling and reference sequence databases. These processes are time consuming and they do not consider novel microbial sequences when aligned with the reference genome, limiting the potential of whole metagenomics. We formulate the problem of predicting human disease from whole-metagenomic data using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a popular supervised learning paradigm. Our proposed alignment-free approach provides higher accuracy in prediction by harnessing the capability of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within a MIL framework and provides interpretability via neural attention mechanism. Results The MIL formulation combined with the hierarchical feature extraction capability of deep-CNN provides significantly better predictive performance compared to popular existing approaches. The attention mechanism allows for the identification of groups of sequences that are likely to be correlated to diseases providing the much-needed interpretation. Our proposed approach does not rely on alignment, assembly and reference sequence databases; making it fast and scalable for large-scale metagenomic data. We evaluate our method on well-known large-scale metagenomic studies and show that our proposed approach outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods for disease prediction.

The applications of machine learning in bioinformatics include predicting of biological processes (for example, prediction tasks on gene function), prevention of diseases and personalized treatment.

Among various methodological variants of deep learning networks, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been extensively studied, especially in the field of image processing. Moreover, Data visualization is considered as an indispensable technique for the exploratory data analysis and becomes a key for discoveries. In this paper, a novel approach based on visualization capabilities of Self-Organizing Maps and deep learning is proposed to not only visualize metagenomic data but also leverage advances in deep learning to improve the disease prediction. Several solutions are also introduced to reduce negative affects of overlapped points to enhance the performance. The proposed approach is evaluated on six metagenomic datasets using species abundance. The results reveal that the proposed visualization not only shows improvements in the performance but also allows to visualize biomedical signatures.},

abstract = {Background The advance of metagenomic studies provides the opportunity to identify microbial taxa that are associated to human diseases. Multiple methods exist for the association analysis. However, the results could be inconsistent, presenting challenges in interpreting the host-microbiome interactions. To address this issue, we introduce Meta-Signer, a novel Metagenomic Signature Identifier tool based on rank aggregation of features identified from multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, LASSO, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, and our recently developed Convolutional Neural Network framework (PopPhy-CNN). Meta-Signer generates ranked taxa lists by training individual machine learning models over multiple training partitions and aggregates them into a single ranked list by an optimization procedure to represent the most informative and robust microbial features. Meta-Signer can rank taxa using two input forms of the data: the relative abundances of the original taxa and taxa from the populated taxonomic trees generated from the original taxa. The latter form allows the evaluation of the association of microbial features at different taxonomic levels to the disease, which is attributed to our novel model of PopPhy-CNN. Results We evaluate Mega-Signer on five different human gut-microbiome datasets. We demonstrate that the features derived from Meta-Signer were more informative compared to those obtained from other available feature ranking methods. The highly ranked features are strongly supported by published literature. Conclusion Meta-Signer is capable of deriving a robust set of microbial features at multiple taxonomic levels for the prediction of host phenotype. Meta-Signer is user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to explore their datasets quickly and efficiently.},

abstract = {Advancements in machine learning in general and in deep learning in particular have achieved great success in numerous fields. For personalized medicine approaches, frameworks derived from learning algorithms play an important role in supporting scientists to investigate and explore novel data sources such as metagenomic data to develop and examine methodologies to improve human healthcare. Some challenges when processing this data type include its very high dimensionality and the complexity of diseases. Metagenomic data that include gene families often have millions of features. This leads to a further increase of complexity in processing and requires a huge amount of time for computation. In this study, we propose a method combining feature selection using perceptron weight-based filters and synthetic image generation to leverage deep-learning advancements in order to predict various diseases based on gene family abundance data. An experiment was conducted using gene family datasets of five diseases, i.e. liver cirrhosis, obesity, inflammatory bowel diseases, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. The proposed method provides not only visualization for gene family abundance data but also achieved a promising performance level.},

abstract = {Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

abstract = {Deep learning has obtained state-of-the-art results in a variety of computer vision tasks and has also been used to solve SAR image classification problems. Deep learning algorithms typically require a large amount of training data to achieve high accuracy. In contrast, the size of SAR image datasets is often comparatively limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, deep memory convolution neural networks (M-Net), to alleviate the problem of overfitting caused by insufficient SAR image samples. Based on the convolutional neural networks (CNN), M-Net adds an information recorder to remember and store samples’ spatial features, and then it uses spatial similarity information of the recorded features to predict unknown sample labels. M-Net's use of this information recorder may cause difficulties for convergence if conventional CNN training methods were directly used to train M-Net. To overcome this problem, we propose a transfer parameter technique to train M-Net in two steps. The first step is to train a CNN, which has the same structure as the part of CNN incorporated in M-Net, to obtain initial training parameters. The second step applies the initialized parameters to M-Net and then trains the entire M-Net. This two-step training approach helps us to overcome the nonconvergence issue, and also reduces training time. We evaluate M-Net using the public benchmark MSTAR dataset, and achieve higher accuracy than several other well-known SAR image classification algorithms.},

With the development of computer vision, plants identification based on deep learning methods can effectively carry out. At present, most of the existing methods use the traditional features such as the shape and texture features for plant identification, and these methods are applicable to plants with large differences in their shapes. Therefore, we develop a multi-branch convolutional neural network with attention (MCNNA) to extract the effective features, and the first part of MCNNA is an attention block, which is used to reduce the influence of background, and the latter part is multi-branch convolutional neural network, which is used to extract the multi-view features through multi-channel.

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of various biosystems, ranging from the human body to the environment. A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes. Results k-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed the computationally costly Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking, and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments, and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87. For large datasets, deep learning outperformed classical methods such as Random Forest and SVM. Availability The software and datasets are available at https://llp.berkeley.edu/micropheno.},

At present, environmental air quality measurement mainly adopts the method that setting air quality detectors at specific monitoring points in cities with fix-time sampling and slow analysis, which is severely restricted by the time and location. To address this problem, recognizing air quality with mobile cameras is a natural idea. Some air quality measurement algorithms related to deep learning mostly adopt a single convolutional neural network to directly train the whole image, which will ignore the difference of each part of the image. In this paper, in order to learn the combined feature extracted from different parts of the environmental image, we propose the double-channel weighted convolutional network (DCWCN) ensemble learning algorithm. This mainly includes two aspects: ensemble learning of DCWCN and self-learning weighted feature fusion. Firstly, we construct a double-channel convolutional neural network, which uses each channel to train different parts of the environment images for feature extraction. Secondly, we propose a feature weights self-learning method, which weights and concatenates the extracted feature vectors to measure the air quality. Moreover, we build an environmental image dataset with random sampling time and locations to evaluate our method. The experiments show that our method can achieve over 87% accuracy on the newly built dataset. At the same time, through comparative experiments, we proved that the proposed method achieves considerable improvement in terms of performance compared with existing CNN based methods.},

abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in deep learning with neural networks, has made a profound impact on fields such as natural language processing, image classification, and language modeling; however, feasibility and potential benefits of the approaches to metagenomic data analysis has been largely under-explored. Deep learning exploits many layers of learning nonlinear feature representations, typically in an unsupervised fashion, and recent results have shown outstanding generalization performance on previously unseen data. Furthermore, some deep learning methods can also represent the structure in a data set. Consequently, deep learning and neural networks may prove to be an appropriate approach for metagenomic data. To determine whether such approaches are indeed appropriate for metagenomics, we experiment with two deep learning methods: i) a deep belief network, and ii) a recursive neural network, the latter of which provides a tree representing the structure of the data. We compare these approaches to the standard multi-layer perceptron, which has been well-established in the machine learning community as a powerful prediction algorithm, though its presence is largely missing in metagenomics literature. We find that traditional neural networks can be quite powerful classifiers on metagenomic data compared to baseline methods, such as random forests. On the other hand, while the deep learning approaches did not result in improvements to the classification accuracy, they do provide the ability to learn hierarchical representations of a data set that standard classification methods do not allow. Our goal in this effort is not to determine the best algorithm in terms accuracy-as that depends on the specific application-but rather to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of each of the approach we discuss and provide insight on how they can be improved for predictive metagenomic analysis.},

It is rare for the existing methods to consider abundance profiles from both known and unknown microbial organisms, or capture the taxonomic relationships among microbial taxa, leading to significant information loss. On the other hand, deep learning has shown unprecedented advantages in classification tasks for its feature-learning ability. However, it encounters the opposite situation in metagenome-based disease prediction since high-dimensional low-sample-size metagenomic datasets can lead to severe overfitting; and black-box model fails in providing biological explanations. To circumvent the related problems, we developed MetaDR, a comprehensive machine learning-based framework that integrates various information and deep learning to predict human diseases. Experimental results indicate that MetaDR achieves competitive prediction performance with a reduction in running time, and effectively discovers the informative features with biological insights.},

However, in many bioinformatics fields (including metagenomics), we encounter the opposite situation where d is significantly greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques would lead to severe over-fitting. Here we aim to improve classification of various diseases with metagenomic data through the use of CNNs. For this we proposed to represent metagenomic data as images. The proposed Met2Img approach relies on taxonomic and t-SNE embeddings to transform abundance data into " synthetic images ". We applied our approach to twelve benchmark data sets including more than 1400 metagenomic samples. Our results show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). We observe that the integration of phylogenetic information alongside abundance data improves classification. The proposed approach is not only important in classification setting but also allows to visualize complex metagenomic data. The Met2Img is implemented in Python.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of the host phenotypes from a microbial sample and identification of the associated microbial markers are important in understanding the impact of the microbiome on the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases within the host. A deep learning tool, PopPhy-CNN, has been developed for the task of predicting host phenotypes using a convolutional neural network (CNN). By representing samples as annotated taxonomic trees and further representing these trees as matrices, PopPhy-CNN utilizes the CNN's innate ability to explore locally similar microbes on the taxonomic tree. Furthermore, PopPhy-CNN can be used to evaluate the importance of each taxon in the prediction of host status. Here, we describe the underlying methodology, architecture, and core utility of PopPhy-CNN. We also demonstrate the use of PopPhy-CNN on a microbial dataset.},

abstract = {The tremendous boost in the next generation sequencing and in the omics technologies makes it possible to characterize human gut microbiome (the collective genomes of the microbial community that reside in our gastrointestinal tract). While some of these microorganisms are considered as essential regulators of our immune system, some others can cause several diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), diabetes, and cancer. IBD, is a gut related disorder where the deviations from the healthy gut microbiome are considered to be associated with IBD. Although existing studies attempt to unveal the composition of the gut microbiome in relation to IBD diseases, a comprehensive picture is far from being complete. Due to the complexity of metagenomic studies, the applications of the state of the art machine learning techniques became popular to address a wide range of questions in the field of metagenomic data analysis. In this regard, using IBD associated metagenomics dataset, this study utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, i) to generate a classification model that aids IBD diagnosis, ii) to discover IBD associated biomarkers, iii) to find subgroups of IBD patients using k means and hierarchical clustering. To deal with the high dimensionality of features, we applied robust feature selection algorithms such as Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (CMIM), Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF), min redundancy max relevance (mRMR) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). In our experiments with 10 fold cross validation, XGBoost had a considerable effect in terms of minimizing the microbiota used for the diagnosis of IBD and thus reducing the cost and time. We observed that compared to the single classifiers, ensemble methods such as kNN and logitboost resulted in better performance measures for the classification of IBD.},

Advancement in genetic sequencing methods for microbiomes has coincided with improvements in machine learning, with important implications for disease risk prediction in humans. One aspect specific to microbiome prediction is the use of taxonomy-informed feature selection. In this review for non-experts, we explore the most commonly used machine learning methods, and evaluate their prediction accuracy as applied to microbiome host trait prediction. Methods are described at an introductory level, and R/Python code for the analyses is provided.},

abstract = {The human gut microbiome has profound influences on the host's health largely through its interference with various intestinal functions. As recent studies have suggested diversity in the human gut microbiome among human populations, it will be interesting to analyse how gut microbiome is correlated with geographical, cultural, and traditional differences. The Japanese people are known to have several characteristic features such as eating a variety of traditional foods and exhibiting a low BMI and long life span. In this study, we analysed gut microbiomes of the Japanese by comparing the metagenomic data obtained from 106 Japanese individuals with those from 11 other nations. We found that the composition of the Japanese gut microbiome showed more abundant in the phylum Actinobacteria, in particular in the genus Bifidobacterium, than other nations. Regarding the microbial functions, those of carbohydrate metabolism were overrepresented with a concurrent decrease in those for replication and repair, and cell motility. The remarkable low prevalence of genes for methanogenesis with a significant depletion of the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii and enrichment of acetogenesis genes in the Japanese gut microbiome compared with others suggested a difference in the hydrogen metabolism pathway in the gut between them. It thus seems that the gut microbiome of the Japanese is considerably different from those of other populations, which cannot be simply explained by diet alone. We postulate possible existence of hitherto unknown factors contributing to the population-level diversity in human gut microbiomes.},
