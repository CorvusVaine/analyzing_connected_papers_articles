Microbes play an important role in the health and disease of humans, pets, and livestock. Characterizing such microbes and their relative abundances are important to identify sample phenotypes such as disease. In the past, machine learning based methods have been applied for prediction of host disease status and overall health based on taxonomic abundance profiles.

abstract = {The composition of the gut microbiome associates with a wide range of human diseases, but the mechanisms underpinning these associations are not well understood. To shift toward a mechanistic understanding, we integrated distinct metagenomic data sets to identify functions encoded in the gut microbiome that associate with multiple diseases, which may be important to human health. Additionally, we identified functions that associate with specific diseases, which may elucidate disease-specific etiologies. We demonstrated that the functions encoded in the microbiome can be used to classify disease status, but the inclusion of additional patient covariates may be necessary to obtain sufficient accuracy. Ultimately, this analysis advances our understanding of the gut microbiome functions that constitute a healthy microbiome and identifies potential targets for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics. ABSTRACT While recent research indicates that human health is affected by the gut microbiome, the functional mechanisms that underlie host-microbiome interactions remain poorly resolved. Metagenomic clinical studies can address this problem by revealing specific microbial functions that stratify healthy and diseased individuals. To improve our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and health, we conducted the first integrative functional analysis of nearly 2,000 publicly available fecal metagenomic samples obtained from eight clinical studies. We identified characteristics of the gut microbiome that associate generally with disease, including functional alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and beta-dispersion. Using regression modeling, we identified specific microbial functions that robustly stratify diseased individuals from healthy controls. Many of these functions overlapped multiple diseases, suggesting a general role in host health, while others were specific to a single disease and may indicate disease-specific etiologies. Our results clarify potential microbiome-mediated mechanisms of disease and reveal features of the microbiome that may be useful for the development of microbiome-based diagnostics. IMPORTANCE The composition of the gut microbiome associates with a wide range of human diseases, but the mechanisms underpinning these associations are not well understood.

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.},

abstract = {The diversity within different microbiome communities that drive biogeochemical processes influences many different phenotypes. Analyses of these communities and their diversity by countless microbiome projects have revealed an important role of metagenomics in understanding the complex relation between microbes and their environments. This relationship can be understood in the context of microbiome composition of specific known environments. These compositions can then be used as a template for predicting the status of similar environments. Machine learning has been applied as a key component to this predictive task. Several analysis tools have already been published utilizing machine learning methods for metagenomic analysis. Despite the previously proposed machine learning models, the performance of deep neural networks is still under-researched. Given the nature of metagenomic data, deep neural networks could provide a strong boost to growth in the prediction accuracy in metagenomic analysis applications. To meet this urgent demand, we present a deep learning based tool that utilizes a deep neural network implementation for phenotypic prediction of unknown metagenomic samples. (1) First, our tool takes as input taxonomic profiles from 16S or WGS sequencing data. (2) Second, given the samples, our tool builds a model based on a deep neural network by computing multi-level classification. (3) Lastly, given the model, our tool classifies an unknown sample with its unlabeled taxonomic profile. In the benchmark experiments, we deduced that an analysis method facilitating a deep neural network such as our tool can show promising results in increasing the prediction accuracy on several samples compared to other machine learning models.},

Blastocystis spp. commonly colonize the gut, but its clinical significance and ecological role are currently unsettled. We have developed a high-sensitivity bioinformatic pipeline to detect Blastocystis subtypes (STs) from shotgun metagenomics, and applied it to 12 large data sets, comprising 1689 subjects of different geographic origin, disease status and lifestyle. We confirmed and extended previous observations on the high prevalence the microrganism in the population (14.9%), its non-random and ST-specific distribution, and its ability to cause persistent (asymptomatic) colonization. These findings, along with the higher prevalence observed in non-westernized individuals, the lack of positive association with any of the disease considered, and decreased presence in individuals with dysbiosis associated with colorectal cancer and Crohn’s disease, strongly suggest that Blastocystis is a component of the healthy gut microbiome. Further, we found an inverse association between body mass index and Blastocystis, and strong co-occurrence with archaeal organisms (Methanobrevibacter smithii) and several bacterial species. The association of specific microbial community structures with Blastocystis was confirmed by the high predictability (up to 0.91 area under the curve) of the microorganism colonization based on the species-level composition of the microbiome. Finally, we reconstructed and functionally profiled 43 new draft Blastocystis genomes and discovered a higher intra subtype variability of ST1 and ST2 compared with ST3 and ST4. Altogether, we provide an in-depth epidemiologic, ecological, and genomic analysis of Blastocystis, and show how metagenomics can be crucial to advance population genomics of human parasites.},

ABSTRACT Microbes serve as sensitive indicators of ecosystem change due to their vast diversity and tendency to change in abundance in response to environmental conditions. Although we most frequently observe these changes to study the microbial community itself, it is increasingly common to use them to understand the surrounding environment. In this way microbial communities can be thought of as powerful sensors capable of reporting shifts in chemical or physical conditions with high fidelity. In this commentary, I further explore this idea by drawing a comparison to the olfactory system, where populations of sensory neurons respond to the presence of specific odorants. The possible combinations of sensory neurons that can transduce a signal are virtually limitless. Yet, the brain can deconvolute the signal into recognizable and actionable data. The further development of machine learning techniques and its application hold great promise for our ability to interpret microbes to detect environmental change.},

It is observed that low vitamin D levels are linked with higher risk, particularly colon cancer in people with IBD. Vitamin D can play a protective role on gut health if started earlier in patients with IBD. Machine learning has many advantages in the healthcare industry as it can predict the presence of a condition much before and efficiently and is found helpful for doctors to suggest better treatment to a patient with the assistance of artificial intelligence. This paper uses an open dataset for the analysis of patients with IBD and their corresponding vitamin D level of Serum 25(OH) D concentration. The data is classified based on severity index into three classes as low risk, moderate, and high-risk patients. Tree classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and ensemble boosted tree classifiers are used for training and comparative analysis is done. Dataset consists of 31 features which include healthy and IBD patients in the age range of 2 to 20 years.

abstract = {Comparing metagenomic samples is crucial for understanding microbial communities. For different groups of microbial communities, such as human gut metagenomic samples from patients with a certain disease and healthy controls, identifying group-specific sequences offers essential information for potential biomarker discovery. A sequence that is present, or rich, in one group, but absent, or scarce, in another group is considered “group-specific” in our study. Our main purpose is to discover group-specific sequence regions between control and case groups as disease-associated markers. We developed a long k-mer (k ≥ 30 bps)-based computational pipeline to detect group-specific sequences at strain resolution free from reference sequences, sequence alignments, and metagenome-wide de novo assembly. We called our method MetaGO: Group-specific oligonucleotide analysis for metagenomic samples. An open-source pipeline on Apache Spark was developed with parallel computing. We applied MetaGO to one simulated and three real metagenomic datasets to evaluate the discriminative capability of identified group-specific markers. In the simulated dataset, 99.11% of group-specific logical 40-mers covered 98.89% disease-specific regions from the disease-associated strain. In addition, 97.90% of group-specific numerical 40-mers covered 99.61 and 96.39% of differentially abundant genome and regions between two groups, respectively. For a large-scale metagenomic liver cirrhosis (LC)-associated dataset, we identified 37,647 group-specific 40-mer features. Any one of the features can predict disease status of the training samples with the average of sensitivity and specificity higher than 0.8. The random forests classification using the top 10 group-specific features yielded a higher AUC (from ∼0.8 to ∼0.9) than that of previous studies. All group-specific 40-mers were present in LC patients, but not healthy controls. All the assembled 11 LC-specific sequences can be mapped to two strains of Veillonella parvula: UTDB1-3 and DSM2008. The experiments on the other two real datasets related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Type 2 Diabetes in Women consistently demonstrated that MetaGO achieved better prediction accuracy with fewer features compared to previous studies. The experiments showed that MetaGO is a powerful tool for identifying group-specific k-mers, which would be clinically applicable for disease prediction.

To avoid library size dependency, one common way of analysing multivariate compositional data is to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on data transformed with the centred log‐ratio, hereafter called a log‐ratio PCA. Two aspects typical of amplicon sequencing data are the large differences in library size and the large number of zeroes. In this study, we show on real data and by simulation that, applied to data that combine these two aspects, log‐ratio PCA is nevertheless heavily dependent on the library size. This leads to a reduction in power when testing against any explanatory variable in log‐ratio redundancy analysis. If there is additionally a correlation between the library size and the explanatory variable, then the type 1 error becomes inflated. We explore putative solutions to this problem.},

We identified a microbiome disease response shared across multiple diseases in elderly subjects that is distinct from that in young/middle-aged individuals, but also a novel set of taxa consistently gained in disease across all age groups. A subset of these taxa was associated with increased frailty in subjects from the ELDERMET cohort.

Conditional generative adversarial networks train two models against each other while leveraging side information learn from a given dataset to compute larger simulated datasets that are representative of the original dataset. In our study, we used a cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease to show that not only can the generative adversarial network generate samples representative of the original data based on multiple diversity metrics, but also that training machine learning models on the synthetic samples can improve disease prediction through data augmentation. In addition, we also show that the synthetic samples generated by this cohort can boost disease prediction of a different external cohort.},

We want to estimate principal components of a fixed transformation of the latent Poisson means. Our motivating example is microbiome data, though the methods apply to many other situations. We develop a semiparametric approach to correct the bias of variance estimators, both for untransformed and transformed (with particular attention to log‐transformation) Poisson means. Furthermore, we incorporate methods for correcting different exposure or sequencing depth in the data. In addition to identifying the principal components, we also address the nontrivial problem of computing the principal scores in this semiparametric framework. Most previous approaches tend to take a more parametric line: for example, fitting a log‐normal Poisson (PLN) model. We compare our method with the PLN approach and find that in many cases our method is better at identifying the main principal components of the latent log‐transformed Poisson means, and as a further major advantage, takes far less time to compute. Comparing methods on real and simulated data, we see that our method also appears to be more robust to outliers than the parametric method.},

abstract = {Summary Human disease prediction from microbiome data has broad implications in metagenomics. It is rare for the existing methods to consider abundance profiles from both known and unknown microbial organisms, or capture the taxonomic relationships among microbial taxa, leading to significant information loss. On the other hand, deep learning has shown unprecedented advantages in classification tasks for its feature-learning ability. However, it encounters the opposite situation in metagenome-based disease prediction since high-dimensional low-sample-size metagenomic datasets can lead to severe overfitting; and black-box model fails in providing biological explanations. To circumvent the related problems, we developed MetaDR, a comprehensive machine learning-based framework that integrates various information and deep learning to predict human diseases. Experimental results indicate that MetaDR achieves competitive prediction performance with a reduction in running time, and effectively discovers the informative features with biological insights.},

abstract = {Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation is an important step in the process of hepatic fibrosis. NOX4 and reactive oxygen species expressed in HSCs play an important role in liver fibrosis. Forsythiaside A (FA), a phenylethanoid glycoside extracted and isolated from Forsythiae Fructus, has significant antioxidant activities. However, it is not clear whether FA can play a role in inhibiting the HSCs activation through regulating NOX4/ROS pathway. Therefore, our purpose is to explore the effect and mechanism of FA on HSCs activation to alleviate liver fibrosis. LX2 cells were activated by TGF-β1 in vitro. MTT assay and Wound Healing assay were used to investigate the effect of FA on TGF-β1-induced LX2 cell proliferation and migration. Elisa kit was used to measure the expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to investigate the expression of fibrosis-related COLI, α-SMA, MMP-1 and TIMP-1, and inflammation-related TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. The hydroxyproline content was characterized using a biochemical kit. The mechanism of FA to inhibit HSCs activation and apoptosis was detected by DCF-DA probe, RT-qPCR, western blot and flow cytometry. NOX4 siRNA was used to futher verify the effect of FA on NOX4/ROS pathway. The results showed that FA inhibited the proliferation and migration of LX2 cells and adjusted the expression of MMP-1, TIMP-1, COLI, α-SMA, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β as well as promoted collagen metabolism to show potential in anti-hepatic fibrosis. Mechanically, FA down-regulated NOX4/ROS signaling pathway to improve oxidation imbalances, and subsequently inhibited PI3K/Akt pathway to suppress proliferation. FA also promoted the apoptosis of LX2 cells by Bax/Bcl2 pathway. Furthermore, the effects of FA on TGF-β1-induced increased ROS levels and α-SMA and COLI expression were weaken by silencing NOX4. In conclusion, FA had potential in anti-hepatic fibrosis at least in part by remolding of extracellular matrix and improving oxidation imbalances to inhibit the activation of HSCs and promote HSCs apoptosis.},

abstract = {Throughout the United States, many eutrophic freshwater bodies experience seasonal blooms of toxic cyanobacteria. These blooms limit recreational uses and pose a threat to both human and ecological health. Traditional bi-weekly chlorophyll-based sampling programs designed to assess overall algal biomass fail to capture important bloom parameters such as bloom timing, duration, and peak intensity. In-situ optical and fluorometric measurements have the potential to fill this gap. However, relating in-situ measurements to relevant water quality measures (e.g. cyanobacterial cell density or chlorophyll concentration) is a challenge that limits the implementation of probe-based monitoring strategies. This study, of Aphanizomenon dominated blooms in Boston's Charles River, combines five years of cyanobacterial cell counts with high resolution insitu sensor measurements to relate turbidity and fluorometric readings to cyanobacterial cell density. Our work compares probe and lab-based estimates of summer-mean chlorophyll concentration and highlights the challenges of working with raw fluorescence in cyanobacteria dominated waterbodies. A strong correlation between turbidity and cyanobacterial cell density (R 2 = 0.84) is used to construct a simple cell-density-estimation-model suitable for triggering rapid bloom-responsesampling and classifying bloom events with a true positive rate of 95%. The approach described in this study is potentially applicable to many cyanobacteria dominated freshwater bodies.},

abstract = {Machine learning-based classification approaches are widely used to predict host phenotypes from microbiome data. Classifiers are typically employed by considering operational taxonomic units or relative abundance profiles as input features. Such types of data are intrinsically sparse, which opens the opportunity to make predictions from the presence/absence rather than the relative abundance of microbial taxa. This also poses the question whether it is the presence rather than the abundance of particular taxa to be relevant for discrimination purposes, an aspect that has been so far overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by performing a meta-analysis on 4,128 publicly available metagenomes associated with multiple case-control studies. At species-level taxonomic resolution, we show that it is the presence rather than the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa to be important when building classification models. Such findings are robust to the choice of the classifier and confirmed by statistical tests applied to identifying differentially abundant/present taxa. Results are further confirmed at coarser taxonomic resolutions and validated on 4,026 additional 16S rRNA samples coming from 30 public case-control studies.},

abstract = {Background Diverse microbiome communities drive biogeochemical processes and evolution of animals in their ecosystems. Many microbiome projects have demonstrated the power of using metagenomics to understand the structures and factors influencing the function of the microbiomes in their environments. In order to characterize the effects from microbiome composition for human health, diseases, and even ecosystems, one must first understand the relationship of microbes and their environment in different samples. Running machine learning model with metagenomic sequencing data is encouraged for this purpose, but it is not an easy task to make an appropriate machine learning model for all diverse metagenomic datasets. Results We introduce MegaR, an R Shiny package and web application, to build an unbiased machine learning model effortlessly with interactive visual analysis. The MegaR employs taxonomic profiles from either whole metagenome sequencing or 16S rRNA sequencing data to develop machine learning models and classify the samples into two or more categories. It provides various options for model fine tuning throughout the analysis pipeline such as data processing, multiple machine learning techniques, model validation, and unknown sample prediction that can be used to achieve the highest prediction accuracy possible for any given dataset while still maintaining a user-friendly experience. Conclusions Metagenomic sample classification and phenotype prediction is important particularly when it applies to a diagnostic method for identifying and predicting microbe-related human diseases. MegaR provides various interactive visualizations for user to build an accurate machine-learning model without difficulty. Unknown sample prediction with a properly trained model using MegaR will enhance researchers to identify the sample property in a fast turnaround time.},

abstract = {Changes in the composition of the microbiome over time are associated with myriad human illnesses. Unfortunately, the lack of analytic techniques has hindered researchers’ ability to quantify the association between longitudinal microbial composition and time-to-event outcomes. Prior methodological work developed the joint model for longitudinal and time-to-event data to incorporate time-dependent biomarker covariates into the hazard regression approach to disease outcomes. The original implementation of this joint modeling approach employed a linear mixed effects model to represent the time-dependent covariates. However, when the distribution of the time-dependent covariate is non-Gaussian, as is the case with microbial abundances, researchers require different statistical methodology. We present a joint modeling framework that uses a negative binomial mixed effects model to determine longitudinal taxon abundances. We incorporate these modeled microbial abundances into a hazard function with a parameterization that not only accounts for the proportional nature of microbiome data, but also generates biologically interpretable results. Herein we demonstrate the performance improvements of our approach over existing alternatives via simulation as well as a previously published longitudinal dataset studying the microbiome during pregnancy. The results demonstrate that our joint modeling framework for longitudinal microbiome count data provides a powerful methodology to uncover associations between changes in microbial abundances over time and the onset of disease. This method offers the potential to equip researchers with a deeper understanding of the associations between longitudinal microbial composition changes and disease outcomes. This new approach could potentially lead to new diagnostic biomarkers or inform clinical interventions to help prevent or treat disease.},

abstract = {Scientific research is shedding more and more light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human body and its role in human health. Empirical evidence shows that the microbiome is strongly interconnected with the host immune system and can contribute to carcinogenesis. Furthermore, studies show that it can be used as a predictor for various diseases. In this work, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. Adopting an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks, MVIB allows to compute a joint stochastic encoding of the input data modalities, which acts as a minimal sufficient statistics of the inputs for the prediction of a target label. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA. Additionally, we perform transfer learning experiments by fine-tuning the model on the target disease dataset after a pre-training on all other source diseases, as well as cross-study generalisation experiments. Furthermore, we adopt a saliency technique to interpret the outcome of the model classification and identify which microbial species and strain-level markers mostly contribute to a certain prediction. The combination of metabolomic data to the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles is also investigated. We show that MVIB achieves competitive results on the microbiome-based disease prediction task and is very fast to train. Author summary The gut microbiome is strongly correlated with human health and can be used to predict various diseases. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning method which allows to efficiently combine heterogeneous data modalities by computing a joint stochastic encoding. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease and we shed light on which microbial species and gene markers contribute significantly to the prediction outcome. Specifically, we analyse species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA from ten different cohorts and obtain competitive classification performance on disease prediction. Furthermore, we adopt a method based on saliency to discover which microbial species and gene markers mostly contribute to the model prediction. Additionally, we perform experiments combining abundance and marker profiles with metabolomic data extracted from mass spectrometry. We show that MVIB can operate accurate microbiome-based disease prediction and is also very fast to train.},

abstract = {BackgroundMetagenomics is the application of modern genomic techniques to investigate the members of a microbial community directly in their natural environments and is widely used in many studies to survey the communities of microbial organisms that live in diverse ecosystems. In order to understand the metagenomic profile of one of the densest interaction spaces for millions of people, the public transit system, the MetaSUB international Consortium has collected and sequenced metagenomes from subways of different cities across the world. In collaboration with CAMDA, MetaSUB has made the metagenomic samples from these cities available for an open challenge of data analysis including, but not limited in scope to, the identification of unknown samples.ResultsTo distinguish the metagenomic profiling among different cities and also predict unknown samples precisely based on the profiling, two different approaches are proposed using machine learning techniques; one is a read-based taxonomy profiling of each sample and prediction method, and the other is a reduced representation assembly-based method. Among various machine learning techniques tested, the random forest technique showed promising results as a suitable classifier for both approaches. Random forest models developed from read-based taxonomic profiling could achieve an accuracy of 91% with 95% confidence interval between 80 and 93%. The assembly-based random forest model prediction also reached 90% accuracy. However, both models achieved roughly the same accuracy on the testing test, whereby they both failed to predict the most abundant label.ConclusionOur results suggest that both read-based and assembly-based approaches are powerful tools for the analysis of metagenomics data. Moreover, our results suggest that reduced representation assembly-based methods are able to simultaneous provide high-accuracy prediction on available data. Overall, we show that metagenomic samples can be traced back to their location with careful generation of features from the composition of microbes and utilizing existing machine learning algorithms. Proposed approaches show high accuracy of prediction, but require careful inspection before making any decisions due to sample noise or complexity.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Eugene V.

abstract = {Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

abstract = {Abstract Background Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has improved our understanding of the human gut microbiota. Various DNA extraction methods have been compared to find protocols that robustly and most accurately reflect the original microbial community structures. However, these recommendations can be further refined by considering the time and cost demands in dealing with samples from very large human cohorts. Additionally, fungal DNA extraction performance has so far been little investigated. Results We compared 6 DNA extraction protocols, MagPure Fast Stool DNA KF Kit B, Macherey Nagel™ NucleoSpin™®Soil kit, Zymo Research Quick-DNA™ Fecal/Soil Microbe kit, MOBIO DNeasy PowerSoil kit, the manual non-commercial protocol MetaHIT, and the recently published protocol Q using 1 microbial mock community (MMC) (containing 8 bacterial and 2 fungal strains) and fecal samples. All samples were manually extracted and subjected to shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Extracting DNA revealed high reproducibility within all 6 protocols, but microbial extraction efficiencies varied. The MMC results demonstrated that bead size was a determining factor for fungal and bacterial DNA yields. In human fecal samples, the MagPure bacterial extraction performed as well as the standardized protocol Q but was faster and more cost-effective. Extraction using the PowerSoil protocol resulted in a significantly higher ratio of gram-negative to gram-positive bacteria than other protocols, which might contribute to reported gut microbial differences between healthy adults. Conclusions We emphasize the importance of bead size selection for bacterial and fungal DNA extraction. More importantly, the performance of the novel protocol MP matched that of the recommended standardized protocol Q but consumed less time, was more cost-effective, and is recommended for further large-scale human gut metagenomic studies.},

Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.Multicohort analysis identifies microbial signatures of colorectal cancer in fecal microbiomes.},

Our approach takes an input format of a 2D matrix representing the phylogenetic tree populated with the relative abundance of microbial taxa in a metagenomic sample.

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of various biosystems, ranging from the human body to the environment. A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes. Results k-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed the computationally costly Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking, and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments, and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87. For large datasets, deep learning outperformed classical methods such as Random Forest and SVM. Availability The software and datasets are available at https://llp.berkeley.edu/micropheno.},

Both 16S amplicon and whole genome shotgun sequencing technologies are currently being used to investigate this relationship, however, the choice of sequencing technology often depends on the nature and experimental design of the study. In principle, the outputs rendered by analysis pipelines are heavily influenced by the data used as input; it is then important to consider that the genomic features produced by different sequencing technologies may emphasize different results. Results In this work, we use public 16S amplicon and whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data from the same dogs to investigate the relationship between sequencing technology and the captured gut metagenomic landscape in dogs. In our analyses, we compare the taxonomic resolution at the species and phyla levels and benchmark 12 classification algorithms in their ability to accurately identify host phenotype using only taxonomic relative abundance information from 16S and WGS datasets with identical study designs. Our best performing model, a random forest trained by the WGS dataset, identified a species ( Bacteroides coprocola) that predominantly contributes to the abundance of leuB , a gene involved in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis; a risk factor for glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. This trend was not conserved when we trained the model using 16S sequencing profiles from the same dogs. Conclusions Our results indicate that WGS sequencing of dog microbiomes detects a greater taxonomic diversity than 16S sequencing of the same dogs at the species level and with respect to four gut-enriched phyla levels. This difference in detection does not significantly impact the performance metrics of machine learning algorithms after down-sampling. Although the important features extracted from our best performing model are not conserved between the two technologies, the important features extracted from either instance indicate the utility of machine learning algorithms in identifying biologically meaningful relationships between the host and microbiome community members. In conclusion, this work provides the first systematic machine learning comparison of dog 16S and WGS microbiomes derived from identical study designs.},

abstract = {BackgroundIn recent years several different fields, such as ecology, medicine and microbiology, have experienced an unprecedented development due to the possibility of direct sequencing of microbioimic samples. Among problems that researchers in the field have to deal with, taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads is one of the most challenging. State of the art methods classify single reads with almost 100% precision. However, very often, the performance in terms of recall falls at about 50%. As a consequence, state-of-the-art methods are indeed capable of correctly classify only half of the reads in the sample. How to achieve better performances in terms of overall quality of classification remains a largely unsolved problem.ResultsIn this paper we propose a method for metagenomics CLassification Improvement with Overlapping Reads (CLIOR), that exploits the information carried by the overlapping reads graph of the input read dataset to improve recall, f-measure, and the estimated abundance of species. In this work, we applied CLIOR on top of the classification produced by the classifier Clark-l. Experiments on simulated and synthetic metagenomes show that CLIOR can lead to substantial improvement of the recall rate, sometimes doubling it. On average, on simulated datasets, the increase of recall is paired with an higher precision too, while on synthetic datasets it comes at expenses of a small loss of precision. On experiments on real metagenomes CLIOR is able to assign many more reads while keeping the abundance ratios in line with previous studies.ConclusionsOur results showed that with CLIOR is possible to boost the recall of a state-of-the-art metagenomic classifier by inferring and/or correcting the assignment of reads with missing or erroneous labeling. CLIOR is not restricted to the reads classification algorithm used in our experiments, but it may be applied to other methods too. Finally, CLIOR does not need large computational resources, and it can be run on a laptop.},

abstract = {Kraken is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning taxonomic labels to metagenomic DNA sequences. Previous programs designed for this task have been relatively slow and computationally expensive, forcing researchers to use faster abundance estimation programs, which only classify small subsets of metagenomic data. Using exact alignment of k-mers, Kraken achieves classification accuracy comparable to the fastest BLAST program. In its fastest mode, Kraken classifies 100 base pair reads at a rate of over 4.1 million reads per minute, 909 times faster than Megablast and 11 times faster than the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn.

abstract = {The human gut microbiome is associated with a large number of disease etiologies. As such, it is a natural candidate for machine learning based biomarker development for multiple diseases and conditions. The microbiome is often analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, several properties of microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing hinder machine learning, including non-uniform representation, a small number of samples compared with the dimension of each sample, and sparsity of the data, with the majority of bacteria present in a small subset of samples. We suggest two novel methods to combine information from different bacteria and improve data representation for machine learning using bacterial taxonomy. iMic and gMic translate the microbiome to images and graphs respectively, and convolutional neural networks are then applied to the graph or image. We show that both algorithms improve performance of static 16S rRNA gene sequence-based machine learning compared to the best state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, these methods ease the interpretation of the classifiers. iMic is then extended to dynamic microbiome samples, and an iMic explainable AI algorithm is proposed to detect bacteria relevant to each condition.},

abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing has contributed important new knowledge about the microbes that live in a symbiotic relationship with humans. With modern sequencing technology it is possible to generate large numbers of sequencing reads from a metagenome but analysis of the data is challenging. Here we present the bioinformatics pipeline MEDUSA that facilitates analysis of metagenomic reads at the gene and taxonomic level. We also constructed a global human gut microbial gene catalogue by combining data from 4 studies spanning 3 continents. Using MEDUSA we mapped 782 gut metagenomes to the global gene catalogue and a catalogue of sequenced microbial species. Hereby we find that all studies share about half a million genes and that on average 300 000 genes are shared by half the studied subjects. The gene richness is higher in the European studies compared to Chinese and American and this is also reflected in the species richness. Even though it is possible to identify common species and a core set of genes, we find that there are large variations in abundance of species and genes.},

abstract = {Modern metagenomic environmental DNA studies are almost completely reliant on next-generation sequencing, making evaluations of these methods critical. We compare two next-generation sequencing techniques – amplicon and shotgun – on water samples across four of Brazil’s major river floodplain systems (Amazon, Araguaia, Paraná, and Pantanal). Less than 50% of phyla identified via amplicon sequencing were recovered from shotgun sequencing, clearly challenging the dogma that mid-depth shotgun recovers more diversity than amplicon-based approaches. Amplicon sequencing also revealed ~27% more families. Overall the amplicon data were more robust across both biodiversity and community ecology analyses at different taxonomic scales. Our work doubles the sampling size in similar environmental studies, and novelly integrates environmental data (e.g., pH, temperature, nutrients) from each site, revealing divergent correlations depending on which data are used. While myriad variants on NGS techniques and bioinformatic pipelines are available, our results point to core differences that have not been highlighted in any studies to date. Given the low number of taxa identified when coupling shotgun data with clade-based taxonomic algorithms, previous studies that quantified biodiversity using such bioinformatic tools should be viewed cautiously or re-analyzed. Nonetheless, shotgun has complementary advantages that should be weighed when designing projects.},

abstract = {Microbial biofilms are commonly present in many industrial processes and can negatively impact performance and safety. Within the oil industry, subterranean biofilms cause biosouring with implications for oil quality, cost, occupational health, and the environment. ABSTRACT Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs) are one of the main sources of biogenic H2S generation in oil reservoirs. Excess H2S production in these systems leads to oil biosouring, which causes operational risks and health hazards and can increase the cost of refining crude oil. Nitrate salts are often added to the system to suppress sulfidogenesis. Because SRB populations can persist in biofilms even after nitrate treatment, identifying shifts in the sessile community is crucial for successful mitigation. However, sampling the sessile community is hampered by its inaccessibility. Here, we use the results of a long-term (148 days) ex situ experiment to identify particular sessile community members from observations of the sample waste stream. Microbial community structure was determined for 731 samples across 20 bioreactors using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. By associating microbial community structure with specific steps in the mitigation process, we could distinguish between taxa associated with H2S production and mitigation. After initiation of nitrate treatment, certain SRB populations increased in the planktonic community during critical time points, indicating the dissociation of SRBs from the biofilm. Predicted relative abundances of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway also increased during the critical time points. Here, by analyzing the planktonic community structure, we describe a general method that uses high-throughput amplicon sequencing, metabolic inferences, and cell abundance data to identify successful biofilm mitigation. We anticipate that our approach is also applicable to other systems where biofilms must be mitigated but cannot be sampled easily. IMPORTANCE Microbial biofilms are commonly present in many industrial processes and can negatively impact performance and safety. Within the oil industry, subterranean biofilms cause biosouring with implications for oil quality, cost, occupational health, and the environment. Because these biofilms cannot be sampled directly, methods are needed to indirectly assess the success of mitigation measures. This study demonstrates how the planktonic microbial community can be used to assess the dissociation of sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB)-containing biofilms. We found that an increase in the abundance of a specific SRB population in the effluent after nitrate treatment can be used as a potential indicator for the successful mitigation of biofilm-forming SRBs. Moreover, a method for determining critical time points for detecting potential indicators is suggested. This study expands our knowledge of improving mitigation strategies for biosouring and could have broader implications in other systems where biofilms lead to adverse consequences.},

abstract = {Oil souring occurs when H2S is generated in oil reservoirs. This not only leads to operational risks and health hazards but also increases the cost of refining crude oil. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms are considered to be the main source of the H2S that leads to oil souring. Substrate competition between nitrate-reducing and sulfate-reducing microorganisms makes biosouring mitigation via the addition of nitrate salts a viable strategy. This study explores the shift in microbial community across different phases of biosouring and mitigation. Anaerobic sand-filled columns wetted with seawater and/or oil were used to initiate the processes of sulfidogenesis, followed by mitigation with nitrate, rebound sulfidogenesis, and rebound control phases (via nitrate and low salinity treatment). Shifts in microbial community structure and function were observed across different phases of seawater and oil setups. Marine bacterial taxa (Marinobacter, Marinobacterium, Thalassolituus, Alteromonas, and Cycloclasticus) were found to be the initial responders to the application of nitrate during mitigation of sulfidogenesis in both seawater- and oil- wetted columns. Autotrophic groups (Sulfurimonas and Desulfatibacillum) were found to be higher in seawater-wetted columns compared to oil-wetted columns, suggesting the potential for autotrophic volatile fatty acid (VFA) production in oil-field aquifers when seawater is introduced. Results indicate that fermentative (such as Bacteroidetes) and oil-degrading bacteria (such as Desulfobacula toluolica) play an important role in generating electron donors in the system, which may sustain biosouring and nitrate reduction. Persistence of certain microorganisms (Desulfobacula) across different phases was observed, which may be due to a shift in metabolic lifestyle of the microorganisms across phases, or zonation based on nutrient availability in the columns. Overall results suggest mitigation strategies for biosouring can be improved by monitoring VFA concentrations and microbial community dynamics in the oil reservoirs during secondary recovery of oil.},
