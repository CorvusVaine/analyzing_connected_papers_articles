abstract = {BackgroundAn open challenge in translational bioinformatics is the analysis of sequenced metagenomes from various environmental samples. Of course, several studies demonstrated the 16S ribosomal RNA could be considered as a barcode for bacteria classification at the genus level, but till now it is hard to identify the correct composition of metagenomic data from RNA-seq short-read data. 16S short-read data are generated using two next generation sequencing technologies, i.e. whole genome shotgun (WGS) and amplicon (AMP); typically, the former is filtered to obtain short-reads belonging to a 16S shotgun (SG), whereas the latter take into account only some specific 16S hypervariable regions. The above mentioned two sequencing technologies, SG and AMP, are used alternatively, for this reason in this work we propose a deep learning approach for taxonomic classification of metagenomic data, that can be employed for both of them.ResultsTo test the proposed pipeline, we simulated both SG and AMP short-reads, from 1000 16S full-length sequences. Then, we adopted a k-mer representation to map sequences as vectors into a numerical space. Finally, we trained two different deep learning architecture, i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep belief network (DBN), obtaining a trained model for each taxon. We tested our proposed methodology to find the best parameters configuration, and we compared our results against the classification performances provided by a reference classifier for bacteria identification, known as RDP classifier. We outperformed the RDP classifier at each taxonomic level with both architectures. For instance, at the genus level, both CNN and DBN reached 91.3% of accuracy with AMP short-reads, whereas RDP classifier obtained 83.8% with the same data.ConclusionsIn this work, we proposed a 16S short-read sequences classification technique based on k-mer representation and deep learning architecture, in which each taxon (from phylum to genus) generates a classification model. Experimental results confirm the proposed pipeline as a valid approach for classifying bacteria sequences; for this reason, our approach could be integrated into the most common tools for metagenomic analysis. According to obtained results, it can be successfully used for classifying both SG and AMP data.},

While the importance of epigenetic regulation has been increasingly recognized, it remains unclear how the global epigenetic patterns are established and maintained. Here I review a number of recent studies with the emphasis on the role of the genomic sequence in shaping the epigenetic landscape. These studies strongly suggest that the sequence information is important not just for controlling target specificity but for orchestrating the diversity of epigenetic patterns among different cell types. The epigenome is maintained by the complex network of a large number of interactions. Integrative approaches are needed to gain insights into these networks.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
In this paper, an alignment-free method for DNA barcode classification that is based on both a spectral representation and a neural gas network for unsupervised clustering is proposed.


METHODS
In the proposed methodology, distinctive words are identified from a spectral representation of DNA sequences. A taxonomic classification of the DNA sequence is then performed using the sequence signature, i.e., the smallest set of k-mers that can assign a DNA sequence to its proper taxonomic category. Experiments were then performed to compare our method with other supervised machine learning classification algorithms, such as support vector machine, random forest, ripper, naïve Bayes, ridor, and classification tree, which also consider short DNA sequence fragments of 200 and 300 base pairs (bp). The experimental tests were conducted over 10 real barcode datasets belonging to different animal species, which were provided by the on-line resource "Barcode of Life Database".


RESULTS
The experimental results showed that our k-mer-based approach is directly comparable, in terms of accuracy, recall and precision metrics, with the other classifiers when considering full-length sequences. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness of our method when a classification is performed task with a set of short DNA sequences that were randomly extracted from the original data. For example, the proposed method can reach the accuracy of 64.8% at the species level with 200-bp fragments. Under the same conditions, the best other classifier (random forest) reaches the accuracy of 20.9%.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that we obtained a clear improvement over the other classifiers for the study of short DNA barcode sequence fragments.},

abstract = {Nucleosome positioning plays an essential role in cellular processes by modulating accessibility of DNA to proteins. Many computational models have been developed to predict genome-wide nucleosome positions from DNA sequences. Comparative analysis of predicted and experimental nucleosome positioning maps facilitates understanding the regulatory mechanisms of transcription and DNA replication. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of existing computational methods is important and useful for biologists to choose appropriate ones in their research. In this article, we carried out a performance comparison among eight widely used computational methods on four species including yeast, fruitfly, mouse and human. In particular, we compared these methods on different regions of each species such as gene sequences, promoters and 5'UTR exons. The experimental results show that the performances of the two latest versions of the thermodynamic model are relatively steadier than the other four methods. Moreover, these methods are workable on four species, but their performances decrease gradually from yeast to human, indicating that the fundamental mechanism of nucleosome positioning is conserved through the evolution process, but more and more factors participate in the determination of nucleosome positions, which leads to sophisticated regulation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Sequence classification plays an important role in metagenomics studies. We assess the deep neural network approach for fungal sequence classification as it has emerged as a successful paradigm for big data classification and clustering. Two deep learning-based classifiers, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a deep belief network (DBN) were trained using our recently released barcode datasets. Experimental results show that CNN outperformed the traditional BLAST classification and the most accurate machine learning based Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier on datasets that had many of the labels present in the training datasets. When classifying an independent dataset namely the “Top 50 Most Wanted Fungi”, CNN and DBN assigned less sequences than BLAST. However, they could assign much more sequences than the RDP classifier. In terms of efficiency, it took the machine learning classifiers up to two seconds to classify a test dataset while it was 53 s for BLAST. The result of the current study will enable us to speed up the taxonomic assignments for the fungal barcode sequences generated at our institute as ~ 70% of them still need to be validated for public release. In addition, it will help to quickly provide a taxonomic profile for metagenomics samples.},

abstract = {Clustering is one of the most well known activities in scientific investigation and the object of research in many disciplines, ranging from Statistics to Computer Science. Following Handl et al., it can be summarized as a three step process: (a) choice of a distance function; (b) choice of a clustering algorithm; (c) choice of a validation method. Although such a purist approach to clustering is hardly seen in many areas of science, genomic data require that level of attention, if inferences made from cluster analysis have to be of some relevance to biomedical research. Unfortunately, the high dimensionality of the data and their noisy nature makes cluster analysis of genomic data particularly difficult. This paper highlights new findings that seem to address a few relevant problems in each of the three mentioned steps, both in regard to the intrinsic predictive power of methods and algorithms and their time performance. Inclusion of this latter aspect into the evaluation process is quite novel, since it is hardly considered in genomic data analysis.},

Nucleosome positioning can be characterised by the location of the nucleosome centres, average occupancy landscapes, the stability of individual nucleosomes, and integral parameters such as the nucleosome repeat length. Nucleosome positioning depends on the DNA sequence affinity of the histone octamer, statistical positioning of nucleosomes by genomic boundaries, chemical modifications of DNA or histones, abundance of linker histones, competitive binding of transcription factors, and nucleosome repositioning by chromatin remodellers. The quantitative description of nucleosome positioning depending on the cell type/state has been addressed using a number of approaches, and this problem still poses significant challenges.},

Recent studies have shown a role of DNA sequences in recruitment of epigenetic regulators. For this reason, the use of more suitable similarities or dissimilarity between DNA sequences could help in the context of epigenetic studies. In particular, alignment-free dissimilarities have already been successfully applied to identify distinct sequence features that are associated with epigenetic patterns and to predict epigenomic profiles. In this work, we focalize the study on the problem of nucleosome classification, providing a benchmark study of 6 alignment free dissimilarity measures between sequences, belonging to the categories of geometric-based, correlation-based, information-based and compression based. Their comparisons have been done versus an alignment based dissimilarity, by measuring the performance of several nearest neighbour classifiers that incorporate each one the considered dissimilarities. Results computed on three dataset of nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences, shows that among the alignment free dissimilarities, the geometric and correlation are the more suitable for the purpose of nucleosome classification, making them a more efficient alternative to the alignment-based similarity measures, which nevertheless are yet the preferred choice when dealing with sequence similarity measurements.},

Nevertheless, the quality of the full length barcode sequences often can not be guaranteed because of the DNA degradation in biological samples, so that only short sequences (mini-barcode) are available. In this paper, a prototype-based classification approach for the analysis of DNA barcode, exploiting a spectral representation of DNA sequences and a memory-based neural network, is proposed. The neural network is a modified version of General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) used as a classification tool. Furthermore, the relationship between the characteristics of different species and their spectral distribution is investigated. Namely, a subset of the whole spectrum of a DNA sequence, composed by very high frequency DNA k-mers, is considered providing a robust system for the classification of barcode sequences. The proposed approach is compared with standard classification algorithms, like Support Vector Machine (SVM), obtaining better results specially when applied to mini-barcode sequences.},

abstract = {Accurate gene prediction in metagenomics fragments is a computationally challenging task due to the short-read length, incomplete, and fragmented nature of the data. Most gene-prediction programs are based on extracting a large number of features and then applying statistical approaches or supervised classification approaches to predict genes. In our study, we introduce a convolutional neural network for metagenomics gene prediction (CNN-MGP) program that predicts genes in metagenomics fragments directly from raw DNA sequences, without the need for manual feature extraction and feature selection stages. CNN-MGP is able to learn the characteristics of coding and non-coding regions and distinguish coding and non-coding open reading frames (ORFs). We train 10 CNN models on 10 mutually exclusive datasets based on pre-defined GC content ranges. We extract ORFs from each fragment; then, the ORFs are encoded numerically and inputted into an appropriate CNN model based on the fragment-GC content. The output from the CNN is the probability that an ORF will encode a gene. Finally, a greedy algorithm is used to select the final gene list. Overall, CNN-MGP is effective and achieves a 91% accuracy on testing dataset. CNN-MGP shows the ability of deep learning to predict genes in metagenomics fragments, and it achieves an accuracy higher than or comparable to state-of-the-art gene-prediction programs that use pre-defined features.},

abstract = {DNA sequence classification is a key task in a generic computational framework for biomedical data analysis, and in recent years several machine learning technique have been adopted to successful accomplish with this task. Anyway, the main difficulty behind the problem remains the feature selection process. Sequences do not have explicit features, and the commonly used representations introduce the main drawback of the high dimensionality. For sure, machine learning method devoted to supervised classification tasks are strongly dependent on the feature extraction step, and in order to build a good representation it is necessary to recognize and measure meaningful details of the items to classify. Recently, neural deep learning architectures or deep learning models, were proved to be able to extract automatically useful features from input patterns. In this work we present two different deep learning architectures for the purpose of DNA sequence classification. Their comparison is carried out on a public data-set of DNA sequences, for five different classification tasks.},

abstract = {Bacteria classification has been deeply investigated with different tools for many purposes,such as early diagnosis, metagenomics, phylogenetics. Classification methods based on ribosomalDNA sequences are considered a reference in this area. We present a new classificatier for bacteriaspecies based on a dissimilarity measure of purely combinatorial nature. This measure is based onthe notion of Minimal Absent Words, a combinatorial definition that recently found applications inbioinformatics. We can therefore incorporate this measure into a probabilistic neural network in orderto classify bacteria species. Our approach is motivated by the fact that there is a vast literature on thecombinatorics of Minimal Absent Words in relation with the degree of repetitiveness of a sequence.We ran our experiments on a public dataset of Ribosomal RNA Sequences from the complex 16S. Ourapproach showed a very high score in the accuracy of the classification, proving hence that our methodis comparable with the standard tools available for the automatic classification of bacteria species.},

abstract = {A nucleosome is a DNA-histone complex, wrapping about 150 pairs of double-stranded DNA. The role of nucleosomes is to pack the DNA into the nucleus of the Eukaryote cells to form the Chromatin. Nucleosome positioning genome wide play an important role in the regulation of cell type-specific gene activities. Several biological studies have shown sequence specificity of nucleosome presence, clearly underlined by the organization of precise nucleotides substrings. Taking into consideration such advances, the identification of nucleosomes on a genomic scale has been successfully performed by DNA sequence features representation and classical supervised classification methods such as Support Vector Machines and Logistic regression. The goal of this work is to propose a classification method for nucleosome positioning that, differently from the proposed method so far, does not make any use of a sequence feature extraction step. Deep neural networks (DNN) or deep learning models, were proved to be able to extract automatically useful features from input patterns. Under this framework, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a recurrent unit that reads a sequence one step at a time and can exploit long range relations. In this work, we propose a DNN model for nucleosome identification on sequences from three different species. Our experiments show that it outperforms classical methods in two of the three data sets and give promising results also for the other.},

abstract = {Motivation Inferring properties of biological sequences--such as determining the species-of-origin of a DNA sequence or the function of an amino-acid sequence--is a core task in many bioinformatics applications. These tasks are often solved using string-matching to map query sequences to labeled database sequences or via Hidden Markov Model-like pattern matching. In the current work we describe and assess a deep learning approach which trains a deep neural network (DNN) to predict database-derived labels directly from query sequences. Results We demonstrate this DNN performs at state-of-the-art or above levels on a difficult, practically important problem: predicting species-of-origin from short reads of 16S ribosomal DNA. When trained on 16S sequences of over 13,000 distinct species, our DNN achieves read-level species classification accuracy within 2.0% of perfect memorization of training data, and produces more accurate genus-level assignments for reads from held-out species than k-mer, alignment, and taxonomic binning baselines. Moreover, our models exhibit greater robustness than these existing approaches to increasing noise in the query sequences. Finally, we show that these DNNs perform well on experimental 16S mock community dataset. Overall, our results constitute a first step towards our long-term goal of developing a general-purpose deep learning approach to predicting meaningful labels from short biological sequences.

abstract = {Background Nucleosomes wrap the DNA into the nucleus of the Eukaryote cell and regulate its transcription phase. Several studies indicate that nucleosomes are determined by the combined effects of several factors, including DNA sequence organization. Interestingly, the identification of nucleosomes on a genomic scale has been successfully performed by computational methods using DNA sequence as input data. Results In this work, we propose CORENup, a deep learning model for nucleosome identification. CORENup processes a DNA sequence as input using one-hot representation and combines in a parallel fashion a fully convolutional neural network and a recurrent layer. These two parallel levels are devoted to catching both non periodic and periodic DNA string features. A dense layer is devoted to their combination to give a final classification. Conclusions Results computed on public data sets of different organisms show that CORENup is a state of the art methodology for nucleosome positioning identification based on a Deep Neural Network architecture. The comparisons have been carried out using two groups of datasets, currently adopted by the best performing methods, and CORENup has shown top performance both in terms of classification metrics and elapsed computation time.},

abstract = {Genome-wide mapping of nucleosomes has revealed a great deal about the relationships between chromatin structure and control of gene expression, and has led to mechanistic hypotheses regarding the rules by which chromatin structure is established. High-throughput sequencing has recently become the technology of choice for chromatin mapping studies, yet analysis of these experiments is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a pipeline for analyzing deep sequencing maps of chromatin structure and apply it to data from S. cerevisiae. We analyze a digestion series where nucleosomes are isolated from under- and overdigested chromatin. We find that certain classes of nucleosomes are unusually susceptible or resistant to overdigestion, with promoter nucleosomes easily digested and mid-coding region nucleosomes being quite stable. We find evidence for highly sensitive nucleosomes located within "nucleosome-free regions," suggesting that these regions are not always completely naked but instead are likely associated with easily digested nucleosomes. Finally, since RNA polymerase is the dominant energy-consuming machine that operates on the chromatin template, we analyze changes in chromatin structure when RNA polymerase is inactivated via a temperature-sensitive mutation. We find evidence that RNA polymerase plays a role in nucleosome eviction at promoters and is also responsible for retrograde shifts in nucleosomes during transcription. Loss of RNA polymerase results in a relaxation of chromatin structure to more closely match in vitro nucleosome positioning preferences. Together, these results provide analytical tools and experimental guidance for nucleosome mapping experiments, and help disentangle the interlinked processes of transcription and chromatin packaging.},

abstract = {DNA sequences are the basic data type that is processed to perform a generic study of biological data analysis. One key component of the biological analysis is represented by sequence classification, a methodology that is widely used to analyze sequential data of different nature. However, its application to DNA sequences requires a proper representation of such sequences, which is still an open research problem. Machine Learning (ML) methodologies have given a fundamental contribution to the solution of the problem. Among them, recently, also Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have shown strongly encouraging results. In this chapter, we deal with specific classification problems related to two biological scenarios: (A) metagenomics and (B) chromatin organization. The investigations have been carried out by considering DNA sequences as input data for the classification methodologies. In particular, we study and test the efficacy of (1) different DNA sequence representations and (2) several Deep Learning (DL) architectures that process sequences for the solution of the related supervised classification problems. Although developed for specific classification tasks, we think that such architectures could be served as a suggestion for developing other DNN models that process the same kind of input.},

abstract = {Nucleosomes are the basic units of eukaryotes. The accurate positioning of nucleosomes plays a significant role in understanding many biological processes such as transcriptional regulation mechanisms and DNA replication and repair. Here, we describe the development of a novel method, termed ZCMM, based on Z-curve theory and position weight matrix (PWM). The ZCMM was trained and tested using the nucleosomal and linker sequences determined by support vector machine (SVM) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), and experimental results showed that the sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values for ZCMM were 91.40%, 96.56%, 96.75%, and 0.88, respectively, and the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value was 0.972. A ZCMM predictor was developed to predict nucleosome positioning in Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), and Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) genomes, and the accuracy (Acc) values were 77.72%, 85.34%, and 93.62%, respectively. The maximum AUC values of the four species were 0.982, 0.861, 0.912 and 0.911, respectively. Another independent dataset for S. cerevisiae was used to predict nucleosome positioning. Compared with the results of Wu’s method, it was found that the Sn, Sp, Acc, and MCC of ZCMM results for S. cerevisiae were all higher, reaching 96.72%, 96.54%, 94.10%, and 0.88. Compared with the Guo’s method ‘iNuc-PseKNC’, the results of ZCMM for D. melanogaster were better. Meanwhile, the ZCMM was compared with some experimental data in vitro and in vivo for S. cerevisiae, and the results showed that the nucleosomes predicted by ZCMM were highly consistent with those confirmed by these experiments. Therefore, it was further confirmed that the ZCMM method has good accuracy and reliability in predicting nucleosome positioning.},

Therefore, the research of nucleosome positioning has invariably received extensive attention. Considering the diversity of DNA sequence representation methods, we tried to integrate multiple features to analyze its effect in the process of nucleosome positioning analysis. This process can also deepen our understanding of the theoretical analysis of nucleosome positioning. Results Here, we not only used frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) to construct DNA sequence features, but also integrated it with other features and adopted the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm. Simultaneously, support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used as predictors for nucleosome positioning prediction analysis, respectively. The integrated feature vector prediction quality is significantly superior to a single feature. After using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature dimension, the prediction quality of H. sapiens dataset has been significantly improved. Conclusions Comparative analysis and prediction on H. sapiens, C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae datasets, demonstrate that the application of FCGR to nucleosome positioning is feasible, and we also found that integrative feature representation would be better.},

abstract = {BackgroundAn organism’s DNA sequence is one of the key factors guiding the positioning of nucleosomes within a cell’s nucleus. Sequence-dependent bending anisotropy dictates how DNA is wrapped around a histone octamer. One of the best established sequence patterns consistent with this anisotropy is the periodic occurrence of AT-containing dinucleotides (WW) and GC-containing dinucleotides (SS) in the nucleosomal locations where DNA is bent in the minor and major grooves, respectively. Although this simple pattern has been observed in nucleosomes across eukaryotic genomes, its use for prediction of nucleosome positioning was not systematically tested.ResultsWe present a simple computational model, termed the W/S scheme, implementing this pattern, without using any training data. This model accurately predicts the rotational positioning of nucleosomes both in vitro and in vivo, in yeast and human genomes. About 65 – 75% of the experimentally observed nucleosome positions are predicted with the precision of one to two base pairs. The program is freely available at http://people.rit.edu/fxcsbi/WS_scheme/. We also introduce a simple and efficient way to compare the performance of different models predicting the rotational positioning of nucleosomes.ConclusionsThis paper presents the W/S scheme to achieve accurate prediction of rotational positioning of nucleosomes, solely based on the sequence-dependent anisotropic bending of nucleosomal DNA. This method successfully captures DNA features critical for the rotational positioning of nucleosomes, and can be further improved by incorporating additional terms related to the translational positioning of nucleosomes in a species-specific manner.},

Our previous study indicated that the bending property of DNA is important in nucleosome formation, particularly in predicting the dyad positions of nucleosomes on a DNA segment. Here, we investigated the role of bending energy in nucleosome positioning and sliding in depth to decipher sequence-directed mechanism. The results show that bending energy is a good physical index to predict the free energy in the process of nucleosome reconstitution in vitro. Our data also imply that there are at least 20% of the nucleosomes in budding yeast do not adopt canonical positioning, in which underlying sequences wrapped around histones are structurally symmetric. We also revealed distinct patterns of bending energy profile for distinctly organized chromatin structures, such as well-positioned nucleosomes, fuzzy nucleosomes, and linker regions and discussed nucleosome sliding in terms of bending energy. We proposed that the stability of a nucleosome is positively correlated with the strength of the bending anisotropy of DNA segment, and both accessibility and directionality of nucleosome sliding is likely to be modulated by diverse patterns of DNA bending energy profile.},

abstract = {Nucleosomes are basic elements of chromatin structure. The positioning of nucleosomes along a genome is very important to dictate eukaryotic DNA compaction and access. Current computational methods have focused on the analysis of nucleosome occupancy and the positioning of well-positioned nucleosomes. However, fuzzy nucleosomes require more complex configurations and are more difficult to predict their positions. We analyzed the positioning of well-positioned and fuzzy nucleosomes from a novel structural perspective, and proposed WaveNuc, a computational approach for inferring their positions based on continuous wavelet transformation. The comparative analysis demonstrates that these two kinds of nucleosomes exhibit different propeller twist structural characteristics. Well-positioned nucleosomes tend to locate at sharp peaks of the propeller twist profile, whereas fuzzy nucleosomes correspond to broader peaks. The sharpness of these peaks shows that the propeller twist profile may contain nucleosome positioning information. Exploiting this knowledge, we applied WaveNuc to detect the two different kinds of peaks of the propeller twist profile along the genome. We compared the performance of our method with existing methods on real data sets. The results show that the proposed method can accurately resolve complex configurations of fuzzy nucleosomes, which leads to better performance of nucleosome positioning prediction on the whole genome.},

Applying FFN to genome-wide nucleosome occupancy data in yeast and human, we identified statistically significant feature patterns that may influence nucleosome formation, many of which are common to the two species. We found that both sequence and structural features are important in nucleosome occupancy prediction. We discovered that, even for the same feature combinations, variations in feature values may lead to differences in predictive power.

abstract = {Based on increment of diversity combined with quadratic discriminant analysis (IDQD), a novel model was developed to distinguish core DNA and linker DNA sequence in C. elegans genome using only k-mer frequency information of sequences in this work. The model achieved a good performance with a high average accuracy and correlation coefficient of 74.85% and 0.498, and the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristics curve (auROC) of our classifier was about 0.829 for C. elegans.},

abstract = {Species identification lies at the heart of biodiversity studies that has in recent years favoured DNA-based approaches. Microbial Biological Resource Centres are a rich source for diverse and high-quality reference materials in microbiology, and yet the strains preserved in these biobanks have been exploited only on a limited scale to generate DNA barcodes. As part of a project funded in the Netherlands to barcode specimens of major national biobanks, sequences of two nuclear ribosomal genetic markers, the Internal Transcribed Spaces and 5.8S gene (ITS) and the D1/D2 domain of the 26S Large Subunit (LSU), were generated as DNA barcode data for ca. 100 000 fungal strains originally assigned to ca. 17 000 species in the CBS fungal biobank maintained at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, Utrecht. Using more than 24 000 DNA barcode sequences of 12 000 ex-type and manually validated filamentous fungal strains of 7 300 accepted species, the optimal identity thresholds to discriminate filamentous fungal species were predicted as 99.6 % for ITS and 99.8 % for LSU. We showed that 17 % and 18 % of the species could not be discriminated by the ITS and LSU genetic markers, respectively. Among them, ∼8 % were indistinguishable using both genetic markers. ITS has been shown to outperform LSU in filamentous fungal species discrimination with a probability of correct identification of 82 % vs. 77.6 %, and a clustering quality value of 84 % vs. 77.7 %. At higher taxonomic classifications, LSU has been shown to have a better discriminatory power than ITS. With a clustering quality value of 80 %, LSU outperformed ITS in identifying filamentous fungi at the ordinal level. At the generic level, the clustering quality values produced by both genetic markers were low, indicating the necessity for taxonomic revisions at genus level and, likely, for applying more conserved genetic markers or even whole genomes. The taxonomic thresholds predicted for filamentous fungal identification at the genus, family, order and class levels were 94.3 %, 88.5 %, 81.2 % and 80.9 % based on ITS barcodes, and 98.2 %, 96.2 %, 94.7 % and 92.7 % based on LSU barcodes. The DNA barcodes used in this study have been deposited to GenBank and will also be publicly available at the Westerdijk Institute's website as reference sequences for fungal identification, marking an unprecedented data release event in global fungal barcoding efforts to date.},
