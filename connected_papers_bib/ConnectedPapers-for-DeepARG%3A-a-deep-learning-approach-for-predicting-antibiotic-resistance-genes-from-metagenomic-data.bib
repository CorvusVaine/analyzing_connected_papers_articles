abstract = {BackgroundGrowing concerns about increasing rates of antibiotic resistance call for expanded and comprehensive global monitoring. Advancing methods for monitoring of environmental media (e.g., wastewater, agricultural waste, food, and water) is especially needed for identifying potential resources of novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), hot spots for gene exchange, and as pathways for the spread of ARGs and human exposure. Next-generation sequencing now enables direct access and profiling of the total metagenomic DNA pool, where ARGs are typically identified or predicted based on the “best hits” of sequence searches against existing databases. Unfortunately, this approach produces a high rate of false negatives. To address such limitations, we propose here a deep learning approach, taking into account a dissimilarity matrix created using all known categories of ARGs. Two deep learning models, DeepARG-SS and DeepARG-LS, were constructed for short read sequences and full gene length sequences, respectively.ResultsEvaluation of the deep learning models over 30 antibiotic resistance categories demonstrates that the DeepARG models can predict ARGs with both high precision (> 0.97) and recall (> 0.90). The models displayed an advantage over the typical best hit approach, yielding consistently lower false negative rates and thus higher overall recall (> 0.9). As more data become available for under-represented ARG categories, the DeepARG models’ performance can be expected to be further enhanced due to the nature of the underlying neural networks. Our newly developed ARG database, DeepARG-DB, encompasses ARGs predicted with a high degree of confidence and extensive manual inspection, greatly expanding current ARG repositories.ConclusionsThe deep learning models developed here offer more accurate antimicrobial resistance annotation relative to current bioinformatics practice. DeepARG does not require strict cutoffs, which enables identification of a much broader diversity of ARGs. The DeepARG models and database are available as a command line version and as a Web service at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/deeparg.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a natural feature of diverse microbial ecosystems. Although recent studies of the antibiotic resistome have highlighted barriers to the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between habitats, the rapid global spread of genes that confer resistance to carbapenem, colistin and quinolone antibiotics illustrates the dire clinical and societal consequences of such events. Over time, the study of antibiotic resistance has grown from focusing on single pathogenic organisms in axenic culture to studying antibiotic resistance in pathogenic, commensal and environmental bacteria at the level of microbial communities. As the study of antibiotic resistance advances, it is important to incorporate this comprehensive approach to better inform global antibiotic resistance surveillance and antibiotic development. It is increasingly becoming apparent that although not all resistance genes are likely to geographically and phylogenetically disseminate, the threat presented by those that are is serious and warrants an interdisciplinary research focus. In this Review, we highlight seminal work in the resistome field, discuss recent advances in the studies of resistomes, and propose a resistome paradigm that can pave the way for the improved proactive identification and mitigation of emerging antibiotic resistance threats.},

abstract = {BackgroundAntibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are widespread but cause problems only when present in pathogens. Environments where selection and transmission of antibiotic resistance frequently take place are likely to be characterized by high abundance and diversity of horizontally transferable ARGs. Large-scale quantitative data on ARGs is, however, lacking for most types of environments, including humans and animals, as is data on resistance genes to potential co-selective agents, such as biocides and metals. This paucity prevents efficient identification of risk environments.ResultsWe provide a comprehensive characterization of resistance genes, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial taxonomic compositions for 864 metagenomes from humans (n = 350), animals (n = 145) and external environments (n = 369), all deeply sequenced using Illumina technology. Environment types showed clear differences in both resistance profiles and bacterial community compositions. Human and animal microbial communities were characterized by limited taxonomic diversity and low abundance and diversity of biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs but a relatively high abundance of ARGs. In contrast, external environments showed consistently high taxonomic diversity which in turn was linked to high diversity of both biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs. Water, sediment and soil generally carried low relative abundance and few varieties of known ARGs, whereas wastewater/sludge was on par with the human gut. The environments with the largest relative abundance and/or diversity of ARGs, including genes encoding resistance to last resort antibiotics, were those subjected to industrial antibiotic pollution and a limited set of deeply sequenced air samples from a Beijing smog event.ConclusionsOur study identifies air and antibiotic-polluted environments as under-investigated transmission routes and reservoirs for antibiotic resistance. The high taxonomic and genetic diversity of external environments supports the hypothesis that these also form vast sources of unknown resistance genes, with potential to be transferred to pathogens in the future.},

abstract = {BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been a worldwide public health concern. Current widespread AMR pollution has posed a big challenge in accurately disentangling source-sink relationship, which has been further confounded by point and non-point sources, as well as endogenous and exogenous cross-reactivity under complicated environmental conditions. Because of insufficient capability in identifying source-sink relationship within a quantitative framework, traditional antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) signatures-based source-tracking methods would hardly be a practical solution.ResultsBy combining broad-spectrum ARG profiling with machine-learning classification SourceTracker, here we present a novel way to address the question in the era of high-throughput sequencing. Its potential in extensive application was firstly validated by 656 global-scale samples covering diverse environmental types (e.g., human/animal gut, wastewater, soil, ocean) and broad geographical regions (e.g., China, USA, Europe, Peru). Its potential and limitations in source prediction as well as effect of parameter adjustment were then rigorously evaluated by artificial configurations with representative source proportions. When applying SourceTracker in region-specific analysis, excellent performance was achieved by ARG profiles in two sample types with obvious different source compositions, i.e., influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant. Two environmental metagenomic datasets of anthropogenic interference gradient further supported its potential in practical application. To complement general-profile-based source tracking in distinguishing continuous gradient pollution, a few generalist and specialist indicator ARGs across ecotypes were identified in this study.ConclusionWe demonstrated for the first time that the developed source-tracking platform when coupling with proper experiment design and efficient metagenomic analysis tools will have significant implications for assessing AMR pollution. Following predicted source contribution status, risk ranking of different sources in ARG dissemination will be possible, thereby paving the way for establishing priority in mitigating ARG spread and designing effective control strategies.},

abstract = {Abstract The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD; https://card.mcmaster.ca) is a curated resource providing reference DNA and protein sequences, detection models and bioinformatics tools on the molecular basis of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR). CARD focuses on providing high-quality reference data and molecular sequences within a controlled vocabulary, the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), designed by the CARD biocuration team to integrate with software development efforts for resistome analysis and prediction, such as CARD’s Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software. Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes & Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants. Here, we describe updates and recent expansions to CARD and its biocuration process, including new resources for community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.},

ABSTRACT Clinical microbiology has long relied on growing bacteria in culture to determine antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, but the use of whole-genome sequencing for antibiotic susceptibility testing (WGS-AST) is now a powerful alternative. This review discusses the technologies that made this possible and presents results from recent studies to predict resistance based on genome sequences. We examine differences between calling antibiotic resistance profiles by the simple presence or absence of previously known genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) against approaches that deploy machine learning and statistical models. Often, the limitations to genome-based prediction arise from limitations of accuracy of culture-based AST in addition to an incomplete knowledge of the genetic basis of resistance. However, we need to maintain phenotypic testing even as genome-based prediction becomes more widespread to ensure that the results do not diverge over time. We argue that standardization of WGS-AST by challenge with consistently phenotyped strain sets of defined genetic diversity is necessary to compare the efficacy of methods of prediction of antibiotic resistance based on genome sequences.},

abstract = {Motivation Much global attention has been paid to antibiotic resistance in monitoring its emergence, accumulation and dissemination. For rapid characterization and quantification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in metagenomic datasets, an online analysis pipeline, ARGs‐OAP has been developed consisting of a database termed Structured Antibiotic Resistance Genes (the SARG) with a hierarchical structure (ARGs type‐subtype‐reference sequence). Results The new release of the database, termed SARG version 2.0, contains sequences not only from CARD and ARDB databases, but also carefully selected and curated sequences from the latest protein collection of the NCBI‐NR database, to keep up to date with the increasing number of ARG deposited sequences. SARG v2.0 has tripled the sequences of the first version and demonstrated improved coverage of ARGs detection in metagenomes from various environmental samples. In addition to annotation of high‐throughput raw reads using a similarity search strategy, ARGs‐OAP v2.0 now provides model‐based identification of assembled sequences using SARGfam, a high‐quality profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM), containing profiles of ARG subtypes. Additionally, ARGs‐OAP v2.0 improves cell number quantification by using the average coverage of essential single copy marker genes, as an option in addition to the previous method based on the 16S rRNA gene.

abstract = {A metagenomic approach and network analysis was used to investigate the wide-spectrum profiles of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their co-occurrence patterns in 50 samples from 10 typical environments. In total, 260 ARG subtypes belonging to 18 ARG types were detected with an abundance range of 5.4 × 10−6–2.2 × 10−1 copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. The trend of the total ARG abundances in environments matched well with the levels of anthropogenic impacts on these environments. From the less impacted environments to the seriously impacted environments, the total ARG abundances increased up to three orders of magnitude, that is, from 3.2 × 10−3 to 3.1 × 100 copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. The abundant ARGs were associated with aminoglycoside, bacitracin, β-lactam, chloramphenicol, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, quinolone, sulphonamide and tetracycline, in agreement with the antibiotics extensively used in human medicine or veterinary medicine/promoters. The widespread occurrences and abundance variation trend of vancomycin resistance genes in different environments might imply the spread of vancomycin resistance genes because of the selective pressure resulting from vancomycin use. The simultaneous enrichment of 12 ARG types in adult chicken faeces suggests the coselection of multiple ARGs in this production system. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that samples belonging to the same environment generally possessed similar ARG compositions. Based on the co-occurrence pattern revealed by network analysis, tetM and aminoglycoside resistance protein, the hubs of the ARG network, are proposed to be indicators to quantitatively estimate the abundance of 23 other co-occurring ARG subtypes by power functions.},

abstract = {Motivation
Antimicrobial resistance is currently one of the main challenges in public health due to the excessive use of antimicrobials in medical treatments and agriculture. The advancements in high throughput next-generation sequencing and development of bioinformatics tools allow simultaneous detection and identification of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) from clinical, food and environment samples, to monitor the prevalence and track the dissemination of these ARGs. Such analyses are however reliant on a comprehensive database of ARGs with accurate sequence content and annotation. Most of the current ARG databases are therefore manually curated, but this is a time-consuming process and the resulting curation errors could be hard to detect. Several secondary ARG databases consolidate contents from different source ARG databases, and hence modifications in the primary databases might not be propagated and updated promptly in the secondary ARG databases.


Results
To address these problems, a validation and integration toolkit called ARGDIT was developed to validate ARG database fidelity, and merge multiple primary ARG databases into a single consolidated secondary ARG database with optional automated sequence re-annotation. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of this toolkit in identifying errors such as sequence annotation typos in current ARG databases and generating an integrated non-redundant ARG database with structured annotation. A toolkit-oriented workflow is also proposed to minimize the efforts in validating, curating, and merging multiple ARG protein or coding sequence databases. Database developers therefore benefit from faster update cycles and lower costs for database maintenance, while ARG pipeline users can easily evaluate the reference ARG database quality.

Here, we present MEGARes 2.0 (https://megares.meglab.org), which incorporates previously published resistance sequences for antimicrobial drugs, while also expanding to include published sequences for metal and biocide resistance determinants. In MEGARes 2.0, the nodes of the acyclic hierarchical ontology include four antimicrobial compound types, 57 classes, 220 mechanisms of resistance, and 1,345 gene groups that classify the 7,868 accessions.

It is often assumed that the abundance and diversity of known resistance genes are representative also for the non-characterized fraction of the resistome in a given environment, but this assumption has not been verified. In this study, this hypothesis is tested, using the resistance gene profiles of 1109 metagenomes from various environments.ResultsThis study shows that the diversity and abundance of known antibiotic resistance genes can generally predict the diversity and abundance of undescribed resistance genes. However, the extent of this predictability is dependent on the type of environment investigated. Furthermore, it is shown that carefully selected small sets of resistance genes can describe total resistance gene diversity remarkably well.ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that knowledge gained from large-scale quantifications of known resistance genes can be utilized as a proxy for unknown resistance factors. This is important for current and proposed monitoring efforts for environmental antibiotic resistance and has implications for the design of risk ranking strategies and the choices of measures and methods for describing resistance gene abundance and diversity in the environment.},

A suite of bioinformatics pipelines and ARG databases are currently available for genomic and metagenomic data analyses. However, different platforms may significantly vary and therefore, it is crucial to choose the tools that are most suitable for the specific analysis being conducted. This review provides a detailed account of available bioinformatics platforms for identification and characterization of ARGs and associated genetic elements within single bacterial isolates and complex environmental samples. It focuses primarily on currently available ARG databases, employing a comprehensive benchmarking pipeline to identify ARGs in four bacterial genomes (Aeromonas salmonicida, Bacillus cereus, Burkholderia sp. and Escherichia coli) and three shotgun metagenomes (human gut, poultry litter and soil) providing insight into which databases should be used for different analytical scenarios.},

abstract = {In this study, the profiles of ARGs in activated sludge from the Shatin WWTP of Hong Kong were investigated using metagenomic analysis over a four-year period. Forty giga base pairs of metagenomic data were generated from eight activated sludge samples collected biannually at two seasons (winter and summer) from July 2007 to January 2011. A structured database of ARGs was proposed and constructed to facilitate the classification of ARGs in the collected samples from metagenomic data using a customized script. Analysis of the data showed the existence of a broad-spectrum of different ARGs, some of which have never been reported in activated sludge before. The most abundant ARGs were aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance genes, followed by resistance genes of sulfonamide, multidrug, and chloramphenicol. Seasonal fluctuations were observed for 3 types of ARGs, that is, resistance genes of tetracycline, sulfonamide, and vancomycin. The abundances of these resistance genes were generally higher in the samples collected in the winters than the samples collected in the contiguous summer. Further analyses were carried out for the presence of subtypes of ARGs for aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and beta-lactam. The abundances of some ARGs subtypes were inconsistent with those reported in previous studies of activated sludge using the PCR approach. Statistical analyses showed that the activated sludge data sets from this study can be distinguished from other types of samples based on their ARGs profiles. Furthermore, the results of this study demonstrate that a high throughput-based metagenomic approach combined with a structured database of ARGs provides a powerful tool for a comprehensive survey of the various ARGs not only in the activated sludge of a WWTP but in other environmental samples as well. Thus, the profiling of ARGs in other ecologically important environmental matrixes may help elucidate those environmental factors contributing to the spread of ARGs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has become an increasing concern for public health. Metagenomics approaches can effectively detect broad profiles of ARGs in environmental samples; however, the detection and subsequent classification of ARG-like sequences are time consuming and have been severe obstacles in employing metagenomic methods. We sought to accelerate quantification of ARGs in metagenomic data from environmental samples.


RESULTS
A Structured ARG reference database (SARG) was constructed by integrating ARDB and CARD, the two most commonly used databases. SARG was curated to remove redundant sequences and optimized to facilitate query sequence identification by similarity. A database with a hierarchical structure (type-subtype-reference sequence) was then constructed to facilitate classification (assigning ARG-like sequence to type, subtype and reference sequence) of sequences identified through similarity search. Utilizing SARG and a previously proposed hybrid functional gene annotation pipeline, we developed an online pipeline called ARGs-OAP for fast annotation and classification of ARG-like sequences from metagenomic data. We also evaluated and proposed a set of criteria important for efficiently conducting metagenomic analysis of ARGs using ARGs-OAP.

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance accounts for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, and its projected increase has made the WHO recognize it as a major global health threat. In the last decade, evidence has mounted suggesting that the environment plays an important role in the progression of resistance. The external environment acts as a source of resistance genes for human pathogens, but is also an important dissemination route allowing the spread of resistant bacteria between different environments and human populations. In this thesis, large-scale DNA sequencing techniques are used to gain a better understanding of the risks associated with environmental antibiotic resistance. A key task in this process is the quantification of the number of antibiotic resistance genes in different environments using metagenomics. However, equally important is to put this information into a larger perspective, by including, for example, taxonomic data, concentrations of antibiotics present, and the genomic contexts of identified resistance genes. This thesis presents a software tool – Metaxa2 – for improved taxonomic analysis of shotgun metagenomic data, which is shown to give more accurate taxonomic classifications of short read data than other tools (Paper I). It also provides theoretically predicted no-effect concentrations for 111 antibiotics (Paper II), and experimentally determined minimal selective concentrations for tetracycline (Paper III). Furthermore, resistance genes are quantified in two environments suggested to pose selective conditions for resistance: sewage treatment plants (Paper IV) and a lake exposed to waste from pharmaceutical production (Paper V). There was no clear evidence for selection of antibiotic resistance genes in sewage treatment plants, however other factors such as oxygen availability seem to have much stronger effects on these microbial communities, which may mask small selective effects of antibiotics and other co-selective agents. In contrast, in the lake subjected to industrial pharmaceutical pollution, resistance genes and mobile genetic elements were both diverse and abundant. Finally, Paper VI shows that travel contributes to the spread of resistance genes against several different classes of antibiotics between countries with higher resistance rates and Sweden. In Papers IV–VI, the genetic contexts of resistance genes were assessed through metagenomic assembly, showing how different resistance genes are linked to each other in different environments. Through these means, the thesis contributes knowledge about risk settings for development and transmission of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be used to guide risk assessment and management schemes to delay or reduce clinical resistance development.},

abstract = {BackgroundSoil bacteria naturally produce antibiotics as a competitive mechanism, with a concomitant evolution, and exchange by horizontal gene transfer, of a range of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Surveys of bacterial resistance elements in edaphic systems have originated primarily from human-impacted environments, with relatively little information from remote and pristine environments, where the resistome may comprise the ancestral gene diversity.MethodsWe used shotgun metagenomics to assess antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) distribution in 17 pristine and remote Antarctic surface soils within the undisturbed Mackay Glacier region. We also interrogated the phylogenetic placement of ARGs compared to environmental ARG sequences and tested for the presence of horizontal gene transfer elements flanking ARGs.ResultsIn total, 177 naturally occurring ARGs were identified, most of which encoded single or multi-drug efflux pumps. Resistance mechanisms for the inactivation of aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol and β-lactam antibiotics were also common. Gram-negative bacteria harboured most ARGs (71%), with fewer genes from Gram-positive Actinobacteria and Bacilli (Firmicutes) (9%), reflecting the taxonomic composition of the soils. Strikingly, the abundance of ARGs per sample had a strong, negative correlation with species richness (r = − 0.49, P < 0.05). This result, coupled with a lack of mobile genetic elements flanking ARGs, suggests that these genes are ancient acquisitions of horizontal transfer events.ConclusionsARGs in these remote and uncontaminated soils most likely represent functional efficient historical genes that have since been vertically inherited over generations. The historical ARGs in these pristine environments carry a strong phylogenetic signal and form a monophyletic group relative to ARGs from other similar environments.},

abstract = {Curation of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) databases is a labor-intensive process that requires expert knowledge to manually collect, correct, and/or annotate individual genes. Correspondingly, updates to existing databases tend to be infrequent, commonly requiring years for completion and often containing inconsistences. Further, because of limitations of manual curation, most existing ARG databases contain only a small proportion of known ARGs (~5k genes). A new approach is needed to achieve a truly comprehensive ARG database, while also maintaining a high level of accuracy. Here we propose a new web-based curation system, ARG-miner, which supports annotation of ARGs at multiple levels, including: gene name, antibiotic category, resistance mechanism, and evidence for mobility and occurrence in clinically-important bacterial strains. To overcome limitations of manual curation, we employ crowdsourcing as a novel strategy for expanding curation capacity towards achieving a truly comprehensive, up-to-date database. We develop and validate the approach by comparing performance of multiple cohorts of curators with varying levels of expertise, demonstrating that ARG-miner is more cost effective and less time-consuming relative to traditional expert curation. We further demonstrate the reliability of a trust validation filter for rejecting confounding input generated by spammers. Crowdsourcing was found to be as accurate as expert annotation, with an accuracy >90% for the annotation of a diverse test set of ARGs.

abstract = {Background Antimicrobial resistance remains a major threat to global health. Profiling the collective antimicrobial resistance genes within a metagenome (the “resistome”) facilitates greater understanding of antimicrobial resistance gene diversity and dynamics. In turn, this can allow for gene surveillance, individualised treatment of bacterial infections and more sustainable use of antimicrobials. However, resistome profiling can be complicated by high similarity between reference genes, as well as the sheer volume of sequencing data and the complexity of analysis workflows. We have developed an efficient and accurate method for resistome profiling that addresses these complications and improves upon currently available tools. Results Our method combines a variation graph representation of gene sets with an LSH Forest indexing scheme to allow for fast classification of metagenomic sequence reads using similarity-search queries. Subsequent hierarchical local alignment of classified reads against graph traversals enables accurate reconstruction of full-length gene sequences using a scoring scheme. We provide our implementation, GROOT, and show it to be both faster and more accurate than a current reference-dependent tool for resistome profiling. GROOT runs on a laptop and can process a typical 2 gigabyte metagenome in 2 minutes using a single CPU. Conclusion We present a method for resistome profiling that utilises a novel index and search strategy to accurately type resistance genes in metagenomic samples. The use of variation graphs yields several advantages over other methods using linear reference sequences. Our method is not restricted to resistome profiling and has the potential to improve current metagenomic workflows.

abstract = {The recent advancements in rapid and affordable DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized diagnostic microbiology and microbial surveillance. The availability of bioinformatics tools and online accessible databases has been a prerequisite for this. We conducted a scientific literature review and here we present a description of examples of available tools and databases for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection and provide future perspectives and recommendations. At least 47 freely accessible bioinformatics resources for detection of AMR determinants in DNA or amino acid sequence data have been developed to date. These include, among others but not limited to, ARG-ANNOT, CARD, SRST2, MEGARes, Genefinder, ARIBA, KmerResistance, AMRFinder, and ResFinder. Bioinformatics resources differ for several parameters including type of accepted input data, presence/absence of software for search within a database of AMR determinants that can be specific to a tool or cloned from other resources, and for the search approach employed, which can be based on mapping or on alignment. As a consequence, each tool has strengths and limitations in sensitivity and specificity of detection of AMR determinants and in application, which for some of the tools have been highlighted in benchmarking exercises and scientific articles. The identified tools are either available at public genome data centers, from GitHub or can be run locally. NCBI and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) provide possibilities for online submission of both sequencing and accompanying phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility data, allowing for other researchers to further analyze data, and develop and test new tools. The advancement in whole genome sequencing and the application of online tools for real-time detection of AMR determinants are essential to identify control and prevention strategies to combat the increasing threat of AMR. Accessible tools and DNA sequence data are expanding, which will allow establishing global pathogen surveillance and AMR tracking based on genomics. There is however, a need for standardization of pipelines and databases as well as phenotypic predictions based on the data.},

abstract = {The intestinal microbiota is considered to be a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) that could potentially be transferred to bacterial pathogens via mobile genetic elements. Yet, this assumption is poorly supported by empirical evidence due to the distant homologies between known ARDs (mostly from culturable bacteria) and ARDs from the intestinal microbiota. Consequently, an accurate census of intestinal ARDs (that is, the intestinal resistome) has not yet been fully determined. For this purpose, we developed and validated an annotation method (called pairwise comparative modelling) on the basis of a three-dimensional structure (homology comparative modelling), leading to the prediction of 6,095 ARDs in a catalogue of 3.9 million proteins from the human intestinal microbiota. We found that the majority of predicted ARDs (pdARDs) were distantly related to known ARDs (mean amino acid identity 29.8%) and found little evidence supporting their transfer between species. According to the composition of their resistome, we were able to cluster subjects from the MetaHIT cohort (n = 663) into six resistotypes that were connected to the previously described enterotypes. Finally, we found that the relative abundance of pdARDs was positively associated with gene richness, but not when subjects were exposed to antibiotics. Altogether, our results indicate that the majority of intestinal microbiota ARDs can be considered intrinsic to the dominant commensal microbiota and that these genes are rarely shared with bacterial pathogens.Development of a structure-based method to predict potential ARDs present in human metagenomes indicates that resistance genes are rarely transferred within the human gut, and that individuals can be clustered into resistotypes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The spread of antibiotic resistance is a growing public health concern. While numerous studies have highlighted the importance of environmental sources and pathways of the spread of antibiotic resistance, a systematic means of comparing and prioritizing risks represented by various environmental compartments is lacking. Here, we introduce MetaCompare, a publicly available tool for ranking ‘resistome risk', which we define as the potential for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to be associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and mobilize to pathogens based on metagenomic data. A computational pipeline was developed in which each ARG is evaluated based on relative abundance, mobility, and presence within a pathogen. This is determined through the assembly of shotgun sequencing data and analysis of contigs containing ARGs to determine if they contain sequence similarity to MGEs or human pathogens. Based on the assembled metagenomes, samples are projected into a 3‐dimensionalhazard space and assigned resistome risk scores. To validate, we tested previously published metagenomic data derived from distinct aquatic environments. Based on unsupervised machine learning, the test samples clustered in the hazard space in a manner consistent with their origin. The derived scores produced a well‐resolved ascending resistome risk ranking of: wastewater treatment plant effluent, dairy lagoon, and hospital sewage.},

abstract = {The risk associated with antibiotic resistance disseminating from animal and human feces is an urgent public issue. In the present study, we sought to establish a pipeline for annotating antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) based on metagenomic assembly to investigate ARGs and their co-occurrence with associated genetic elements. Genetic elements found on the assembled genomic fragments include mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs). We then explored the hosts of these resistance genes and the shared resistome of pig, chicken and human fecal samples. High levels of tetracycline, multidrug, erythromycin, and aminoglycoside resistance genes were discovered in these fecal samples. In particular, significantly high level of ARGs (7762 ×/Gb) was detected in adult chicken feces, indicating higher ARG contamination level than other fecal samples. Many ARGs arrangements (e.g., macA-macB and tetA-tetR) were discovered shared by chicken, pig and human feces. In addition, MGEs such as the aadA5-dfrA17-carrying class 1 integron were identified on an assembled scaffold of chicken feces, and are carried by human pathogens. Differential coverage binning analysis revealed significant ARG enrichment in adult chicken feces. A draft genome, annotated as multidrug resistant Escherichia coli, was retrieved from chicken feces metagenomes and was determined to carry diverse ARGs (multidrug, acriflavine, and macrolide). The present study demonstrates the determination of ARG hosts and the shared resistome from metagenomic data sets and successfully establishes the relationship between ARGs, hosts, and environments. This ARG annotation pipeline based on metagenomic assembly will help to bridge the knowledge gaps regarding ARG-associated genes and ARG hosts with metagenomic data sets. Moreover, this pipeline will facilitate the evaluation of environmental risks in the genetic context of ARGs.},

abstract = {Background Antimicrobial resistance remains a growing and significant concern in human and veterinary medicine. Current laboratory methods for the detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistant bacteria are limited in their effectiveness and scope. With the rapidly developing field of whole genome sequencing beginning to be utilised in clinical practice, the ability to interrogate sequencing data quickly and easily for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes will become increasingly important and useful for informing clinical decisions. Additionally, use of such tools will provide insight into the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic samples such as those used in environmental monitoring. Results Here we present the Search Engine for Antimicrobial Resistance (SEAR), a pipeline and web interface for detection of horizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in raw sequencing data. The pipeline provides gene information, abundance estimation and the reconstructed sequence of antimicrobial resistance genes; it also provides web links to additional information on each gene. The pipeline utilises clustering and read mapping to annotate full-length genes relative to a user-defined database. It also uses local alignment of annotated genes to a range of online databases to provide additional information. We demonstrate SEAR’s application in the detection and abundance estimation of antimicrobial resistance genes in two novel environmental metagenomes, 32 human faecal microbiome datasets and 126 clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei. Conclusions We have developed a pipeline that contributes to the improved capacity for antimicrobial resistance detection afforded by next generation sequencing technologies, allowing for rapid detection of antimicrobial resistance genes directly from sequencing data. SEAR uses raw sequencing data via an intuitive interface so can be run rapidly without requiring advanced bioinformatic skills or resources. Finally, we show that SEAR is effective in detecting antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic and isolate sequencing data from both environmental metagenomes and sequencing data from clinical isolates.},

abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are implicated as hotspots for the dissemination of antibacterial resistance into the environment. However, the in situ processes governing removal, persistence, and evolution of resistance genes during wastewater treatment remain poorly understood. Here, we used quantitative metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to achieve a broad-spectrum view of the flow and expression of genes related to antibacterial resistance to over 20 classes of antibiotics, 65 biocides, and 22 metals. All compartments of 12 WWTPs share persistent resistance genes with detectable transcriptional activities that were comparatively higher in the secondary effluent, where mobility genes also show higher relative abundance and expression ratios. The richness and abundance of resistance genes vary greatly across metagenomes from different treatment compartments, and their relative and absolute abundances correlate with bacterial community composition and biomass concentration. No strong drivers of resistome composition could be identified among the chemical stressors analyzed, although the sub-inhibitory concentration (hundreds of ng/L) of macrolide antibiotics in wastewater correlates with macrolide and vancomycin resistance genes. Contig-based analysis shows considerable co-localization between resistance and mobility genes and implies a history of substantial horizontal resistance transfer involving human bacterial pathogens. Based on these findings, we propose future inclusion of mobility incidence (M%) and host pathogenicity of antibiotic resistance genes in their quantitative health risk ranking models with an ultimate goal to assess the biological significance of wastewater resistomes with regard to disease control in humans or domestic livestock.},

Interpretation of specific information from metagenomic data is especially a challenge for environmental samples as current annotation systems only offer broad classification of microbial diversity and function. Therefore, I developed MetaStorm, a public web-service that facilitates customization of computational analysis for metagenomic data. The identification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from metagenomic data is carried out by searches against curated databases producing a high rate of false negatives. Thus, I developed DeepARG, a deep learning approach that uses the distribution of sequence alignments to predict over 30 antibiotic resistance categories with a high accuracy. Curation of ARGs is a labor intensive process where errors can be easily propagated. Thus, I developed ARGminer, a web platform dedicated to the annotation and inspection of ARGs by using crowdsourcing. Effective environmental monitoring tools should ideally capture not only ARGs, but also mobile genetic elements and indicators of co-selective forces, such as metal resistance genes. Here, I introduce NanoARG, an online computational resource that takes advantage of the long reads produced by nanopore sequencing technology to provide insights into mobility, co-selection, and pathogenicity. Sequence alignment has been one of the preferred methods for analyzing metagenomic data. However, it is slow and requires high computing resources. Therefore, I developed MetaMLP, a machine learning approach that uses a novel representation of protein sequences to perform classifications over protein functions. The method is accurate, is able to identify a larger number of hits compared to sequence alignments, and is >50 times faster than sequence alignment techniques. Computational Tools for Annotating Antibiotic Resistance in Metagenomic Data Gustavo Alonso Arango Argoty GENERAL AUDIENCE ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to human public health. It has been estimated that the number of deaths caused by AMR will surpass the ones caused by cancer on 2050. The seriousness of these projections requires urgent actions to understand and control the spread of AMR. In the last few years, metagenomics has stand out as a reliable tool for the analysis of the microbial diversity and the AMR. By the use of next generation sequencing, metagenomic studies can generate millions of short sequencing reads that are processed by computational tools. However, with the rapid adoption of metagenomics, a large amount of data has been generated. This situation requires the development of computational tools and pipelines to manage the data scalability, accessibility, and performance. In this thesis, several strategies varying from command line, web-based platforms to machine learning have been developed to address these computational challenges. In particular, by the development of computational pipelines to process metagenomics data in the cloud and distributed systems, the development of machine learning and deep learning tools to ease the computational cost of detecting antibiotic resistance genes in metagenomic data, and the integration of crowdsourcing as a way to curate and validate antibiotic resistance genes.},

abstract = {Waste water and waste water treatment plants can act as reservoirs and environmental suppliers of antibiotic resistance. They have also been proposed to be hotspots for horizontal gene transfer, enabling the spread of antibiotic resistance genes between different bacterial species. Waste water contains antibiotics, disinfectants, and metals which can form a selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, even in low concentrations. Our knowledge of antibiotic resistance in waste water has increased tremendously in the past few years with advances in the molecular methods available. However, there are still some gaps in our knowledge on the subject, such as how active is horizontal gene transfer in waste water and what is the role of the waste water treatment plant in the environmental resistome? The purpose of this review is to briefly describe some of the main methods for studying antibiotic resistance in waste waters and the latest research and main knowledge gaps on the issue. In addition, some future research directions are proposed.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance has become an imminent concern for public health. As methods for detection and characterization of antimicrobial resistance move from targeted culture and polymerase chain reaction to high throughput metagenomics, appropriate resources for the analysis of large-scale data are required. Currently, antimicrobial resistance databases are tailored to smaller-scale, functional profiling of genes using highly descriptive annotations. Such characteristics do not facilitate the analysis of large-scale, ecological sequence datasets such as those produced with the use of metagenomics for surveillance. In order to overcome these limitations, we present MEGARes (https://megares.meglab.org), a hand-curated antimicrobial resistance database and annotation structure that provides a foundation for the development of high throughput acyclical classifiers and hierarchical statistical analysis of big data. MEGARes can be browsed as a stand-alone resource through the website or can be easily integrated into sequence analysis pipelines through download. Also via the website, we provide documentation for AmrPlusPlus, a user-friendly Galaxy pipeline for the analysis of high throughput sequencing data that is pre-packaged for use with the MEGARes database.},

However, the field of antibiotic drug discovery and the public health monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is beginning to exploit the power of genome and metagenome sequencing. The creation of novel AMR bioinformatics tools and databases and their continued development will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and threat severity of antibiotic resistance, while simultaneously improving our ability to accurately predict and screen for antibiotic resistance genes within environmental, agricultural, and clinical settings. To do so, efforts must be focused toward exploiting the advancements of genome sequencing and information technology. Currently, AMR bioinformatics software and databases reflect different scopes and functions, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. A review of the available tools reveals common approaches and reference data but also reveals gaps in our curated data, models, algorithms, and data‐sharing tools that must be addressed to conquer the limitations and areas of unmet need within the AMR research field before DNA sequencing can be fully exploited for AMR surveillance and improved clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {BackgroundEnvironmental and commensal bacteria maintain a diverse and largely unknown collection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that, over time, may be mobilized and transferred to pathogens. Metagenomics enables cultivation-independent characterization of bacterial communities but the resulting data is noisy and highly fragmented, severely hampering the identification of previously undescribed ARGs. We have therefore developed fARGene, a method for identification and reconstruction of ARGs directly from shotgun metagenomic data.ResultsfARGene uses optimized gene models and can therefore with high accuracy identify previously uncharacterized resistance genes, even if their sequence similarity to known ARGs is low. By performing the analysis directly on the metagenomic fragments, fARGene also circumvents the need for a high-quality assembly. To demonstrate the applicability of fARGene, we reconstructed β-lactamases from five billion metagenomic reads, resulting in 221 ARGs, of which 58 were previously not reported. Based on 38 ARGs reconstructed by fARGene, experimental verification showed that 81% provided a resistance phenotype in Escherichia coli. Compared to other methods for detecting ARGs in metagenomic data, fARGene has superior sensitivity and the ability to reconstruct previously unknown genes directly from the sequence reads.ConclusionsWe conclude that fARGene provides an efficient and reliable way to explore the unknown resistome in bacterial communities. The method is applicable to any type of ARGs and is freely available via GitHub under the MIT license.},

While antibiotics have been naturally produced by environmental bacteria for millions of years, modern widespread use of antibiotics has enriched resistance mechanisms in human‐impacted bacterial environments. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) continue to emerge and spread rapidly. To combat the global threat of antibiotic resistance, researchers must develop methods to rapidly characterize AROs and ARGs, monitor their spread across space and time, and identify novel ARGs and resistance pathways. We review how high‐throughput sequencing‐based methods can be combined with classic culture‐based assays to characterize, monitor, and track AROs and ARGs. Then, we evaluate genomic and metagenomic methods for identifying ARGs and biosynthetic pathways for novel antibiotics from genomic data sets. Together, these genomic analyses can improve surveillance and prediction of emerging resistance threats and accelerate the development of new antibiotic therapies to combat resistance.},

The availability of large amount of sequence data, owing to the advancement of novel sequencing technologies, have conceded exciting possibilities for developing suitable AMR exploration tools. However, the level of complexity of bioinformatic analyses has raised as well, since the achievement of desired results involves executing several challenging steps. Here, sraX is proposed as a fully automated analytical pipeline for performing a precise resistome analysis. Our nominated tool is capable of scrutinizing hundreds of bacterial genomes in-parallel for detecting and annotating putative resistant determinants. Particularly, sraX presents unique features: genomic context analysis, validation of known mutations conferring resistance, illustration of drug classes and type of mutated loci proportions and integration of results into a single hyperlinked navigable HTML-formatted file. Furthermore, sraX also exhibits relevant operational features since the complete analysis is accomplished by executing a single-command step. The capacity and efficacy of sraX was demonstrated by re-analyzing 197 strains belonging to Enterococcus spp., from which we confirmed 99.15% of all detection events that were reported in the original study. sraX can be downloaded from https://github.com/lgpdevtools/srax.},

abstract = {Infectious diseases, particularly bacterial infections, are emerging at an unprecedented rate, posing a serious challenge to public health and the global economy. Different virulence factors (VFs) work in concert to enable pathogenic bacteria to successfully adhere, reproduce and cause damage to host cells, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) allow pathogens to evade otherwise curable treatments. To understand the causal relationship between microbiome composition, function and disease, both VFs and ARGs in microbial data must be identified. Most existing computational models cannot simultaneously identify VFs or ARGs, hindering the related research. The best hit approaches are currently the main tools to identify VFs and ARGs concurrently; yet they usually have high false-negative rates and are very sensitive to the cut-off thresholds. In this work, we proposed a hybrid computational framework called HyperVR to predict VFs and ARGs at the same time. Specifically, HyperVR integrates key genetic features and then stacks classical ensemble learning methods and deep learning for training and prediction. HyperVR accurately predicts VFs, ARGs and negative genes (neither VFs nor ARGs) simultaneously, with both high precision (>0.91) and recall (>0.91) rates. Also, HyperVR keeps the flexibility to predict VFs or ARGs individually. Regarding novel VFs and ARGs, the VFs and ARGs in metagenomic data, and pseudo VFs and ARGs (gene fragments), HyperVR has shown good prediction, outperforming the current state-of-the-art predition tools and best hit approaches in terms of precision and recall. HyperVR is a powerful tool for predicting VFs and ARGs simultaneously by using only gene sequences and without strict cut-off thresholds, hence making prediction straightforward and accurate.},

Infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens can cause empiric treatment failure, and for infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria which can overcome antibiotics of "last resort" there exists no alternative treatments.

Pathogens can persist on hospital surfaces and plumbing for months to years, acquire new antibiotic resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer, and initiate outbreaks of hospital-associated infections by spreading to patients via healthcare workers and visitors. Advancements in next-generation sequencing of bacterial genomes and metagenomes have expanded our ability to (1) identify species and track distinct strains, (2) comprehensively profile antibiotic resistance genes, and (3) resolve the mobile elements that facilitate intra- and intercellular gene transfer.
