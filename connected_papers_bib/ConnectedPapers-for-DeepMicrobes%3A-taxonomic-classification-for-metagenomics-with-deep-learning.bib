abstract = {Taxonomic classification is a crucial step for metagenomics applications including disease diagnostics, microbiome analyses, and outbreak tracing. Yet it is unknown what deep learning architecture can capture microbial genome-wide features relevant to this task. We report DeepMicrobes (https://github.com/MicrobeLab/DeepMicrobes), a computational framework that can perform large-scale training on > 10,000 RefSeq complete microbial genomes and accurately predict the species-of-origin of whole metagenome shotgun sequencing reads. We show the advantage of DeepMicrobes over state-of-the-art tools in precisely identifying species from microbial community sequencing data. Therefore, DeepMicrobes expands the toolbox of taxonomic classification for metagenomics and enables the development of further deep learning-based bioinformatics algorithms for microbial genomic sequence analysis.},

abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomics characterizes the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities by sequencing DNA directly from an environmental sample. One of the main challenges in metagenomics data analysis is the binning step, where each sequenced read is assigned to a taxonomic clade. Because of the large volume of metagenomics datasets, binning methods need fast and accurate algorithms that can operate with reasonable computing requirements. While standard alignment-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance, compositional approaches that assign a taxonomic class to a DNA read based on the k-mers it contains have the potential to provide faster solutions. Results: We propose a new rank-flexible machine learning-based compositional approach for taxonomic assignment of metagenomics reads and show that it benefits from increasing the number of fragments sampled from reference genome to tune its parameters, up to a coverage of about 10, and from increasing the k-mer size to about 12. Tuning the method involves training machine learning models on about 108 samples in 107 dimensions, which is out of reach of standard softwares but can be done efficiently with modern implementations for large-scale machine learning. The resulting method is competitive in terms of accuracy with well-established alignment and composition-based tools for problems involving a small to moderate number of candidate species and for reasonable amounts of sequencing errors. We show, however, that machine learning-based compositional approaches are still limited in their ability to deal with problems involving a greater number of species and more sensitive to sequencing errors. We finally show that the new method outperforms the state-of-the-art in its ability to classify reads from species of lineage absent from the reference database and confirm that compositional approaches achieve faster prediction times, with a gain of 2–17 times with respect to the BWA-MEM short read mapper, depending on the number of candidate species and the level of sequencing noise.

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomics is a powerful, yet computationally challenging, technique compared to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for decoding the composition and structure of microbial communities. Current analyses of metagenomic data are primarily based on taxonomic classification, which is limited in feature resolution. ABSTRACT We introduce the operational genomic unit (OGU) method, a metagenome analysis strategy that directly exploits sequence alignment hits to individual reference genomes as the minimum unit for assessing the diversity of microbial communities and their relevance to environmental factors. This approach is independent of taxonomic classification, granting the possibility of maximal resolution of community composition, and organizes features into an accurate hierarchy using a phylogenomic tree. The outputs are suitable for contemporary analytical protocols for community ecology, differential abundance, and supervised learning while supporting phylogenetic methods, such as UniFrac and phylofactorization, that are seldom applied to shotgun metagenomics despite being prevalent in 16S rRNA gene amplicon studies. As demonstrated in two real-world case studies, the OGU method produces biologically meaningful patterns from microbiome data sets. Such patterns further remain detectable at very low metagenomic sequencing depths. Compared with taxonomic unit-based analyses implemented in currently adopted metagenomics tools, and the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants, this method shows superiority in informing biologically relevant insights, including stronger correlation with body environment and host sex on the Human Microbiome Project data set and more accurate prediction of human age by the gut microbiomes of Finnish individuals included in the FINRISK 2002 cohort. We provide Woltka, a bioinformatics tool to implement this method, with full integration with the QIIME 2 package and the Qiita web platform, to facilitate adoption of the OGU method in future metagenomics studies. IMPORTANCE Shotgun metagenomics is a powerful, yet computationally challenging, technique compared to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for decoding the composition and structure of microbial communities. Current analyses of metagenomic data are primarily based on taxonomic classification, which is limited in feature resolution. To solve these challenges, we introduce operational genomic units (OGUs), which are the individual reference genomes derived from sequence alignment results, without further assigning them taxonomy. The OGU method advances current read-based metagenomics in two dimensions: (i) providing maximal resolution of community composition and (ii) permitting use of phylogeny-aware tools. Our analysis of real-world data sets shows that it is advantageous over currently adopted metagenomic analysis methods and the finest-grained 16S rRNA analysis methods in predicting biological traits. We thus propose the adoption of OGUs as an effective practice in metagenomic studies.},

abstract = {Background Metagenome sampling bias for geographical location and lifestyle is partially responsible for the incomplete catalog of reference genomes of gut microbial species. Thus, genome assembly from currently under-represented populations may effectively expand the reference gut microbiome and improve taxonomic and functional profiling. Methods We assembled genomes using public whole-metagenomic shotgun sequencing (WMS) data for 110 and 645 fecal samples from India and Japan, respectively. In addition, we assembled genomes from newly generated WMS data for 90 fecal samples collected from Korea. Expecting genome assembly for low-abundance species may require a much deeper sequencing than that usually employed, so we performed ultra-deep WMS (> 30 Gbp or > 100 million read pairs) for the fecal samples from Korea. We consequently assembled 29,082 prokaryotic genomes from 845 fecal metagenomes for the three under-represented Asian countries and combined them with the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) to generate an expanded catalog, the Human Reference Gut Microbiome (HRGM). Results HRGM contains 232,098 non-redundant genomes for 5414 representative prokaryotic species including 780 that are novel, > 103 million unique proteins, and > 274 million single-nucleotide variants. This is an over 10% increase from the UHGG. The new 780 species were enriched for the Bacteroidaceae family, including species associated with high-fiber and seaweed-rich diets. Single-nucleotide variant density was positively associated with the speciation rate of gut commensals. We found that ultra-deep sequencing facilitated the assembly of genomes for low-abundance taxa, and deep sequencing (e.g., > 20 million read pairs) may be needed for the profiling of low-abundance taxa. Importantly, the HRGM significantly improved the taxonomic and functional classification of sequencing reads from fecal samples. Finally, analysis of human self-antigen homologs on the HRGM species genomes suggested that bacterial taxa with high cross-reactivity potential may contribute more to the pathogenesis of gut microbiome-associated diseases than those with low cross-reactivity potential by promoting inflammatory condition. Conclusions By including gut metagenomes from previously under-represented Asian countries, Korea, India, and Japan, we developed a substantially expanded microbiome catalog, HRGM. Information of the microbial genomes and coding genes is publicly available (www.mbiomenet.org/HRGM/). HRGM will facilitate the identification and functional analysis of disease-associated gut microbiota.

abstract = {We propose MT-MAG, a novel machine learning-based software tool for the complete or partial hierarchically-structured taxonomic classification of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). MT-MAG is capable of classifying large and diverse metagenomic datasets: a total of 245.68 Gbp in the training sets, and 9.6 Gbp in the test sets analyzed in this study. MT-MAG is, to the best of our knowledge, the first machine learning method for taxonomic assignment of metagenomic data that offers a “partial classification” option. MT-MAG outputs complete or partial classification paths, and interpretable numerical classification confidences of its classifications, at all taxonomic ranks. To assess the performance of MT-MAG, we define a “weighted classification accuracy,” with a weighting scheme reflecting the fact that partial classifications at different ranks are not equally informative. For the two benchmarking datasets analyzed (genomes from human gut microbiome species, and bacterial and archaeal genomes assembled from cow rumen metagenomic sequences), MT-MAG achieves an average of 80.13% in weighted classification accuracy. At the Species level, MT-MAG outperforms DeepMicrobes, the only other comparable software tool, by an average of 35.75% in weighted classification accuracy. In addition, MT-MAG is able to completely classify an average of 67.7% of the sequences at the Species level, compared with DeepMicrobes which only classifies 47.45%. Moreover, MT-MAG provides additional information for sequences that are not completely classified at the Species level, resulting in the partial or complete classification of 95.15%, of the genomes in the datasets analyzed. In particular, MT-MAG classifies, on average, 88.84% of the test sequences to the Phylum level, 88.39% to the Class level, 86.81% to the Order level, 81.17% to the Family level, and 71.13% to the Genus level.},

abstract = {A fundamental question appears in many bioinformatics applications: Does a sequencing read belong to a large dataset of genomes from some broad taxonomic group, even when the closest match in the set is evolutionarily divergent from the query? For example, low-coverage genome sequencing (skimming) projects either assemble the organelle genome or compute genomic distances directly from unassembled reads. Using unassembled reads needs contamination detection because samples often include reads from unintended groups of species. Similarly, assembling the organelle genome needs distinguishing organelle and nuclear reads. While k-mer-based methods have shown promise in read-matching, prior studies have shown that existing methods are insufficiently sensitive for contamination detection. Here, we introduce a new read-matching tool called CONSULT that tests whether k-mers from a query fall within a user-specified distance of the reference dataset using locality-sensitive hashing. Taking advantage of large memory machines available nowadays, CONSULT libraries accommodate tens of thousands of microbial species. Our results show that CONSULT has higher true-positive and lower false-positive rates of contamination detection than leading methods such as Kraken-II and improves distance calculation from genome skims. We also demonstrate that CONSULT can distinguish organelle reads from nuclear reads, leading to dramatic improvements in skims-based mitochondrial assemblies.},

abstract = {Coherent genomic groups are frequently used as a proxy for bacterial species delineation through computation of overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI). Average nucleotide identity (ANI) is a widely employed method for estimating relatedness between genomic sequences. However, pairwise comparisons of genome sequences based on ANI is relatively computationally intensive and therefore precludes analyses of large datasets composed of thousands of genome sequences. In this work we proposed a workflow to compute and visualize relationships between genomic sequences. A dataset containing more than 3,500 Pseudomonas genome sequences was successfully classified with an alternative OGRI based on k-mer counts in few hours with the same precision as ANI. A new visualization method based on zoomable circle packing was employed for assessing relationships among the 350 groups generated. Amendment of databases with these Pseudomonas groups greatly improved the classification of metagenomic read sets with k-mer-based classifier.

Retrieving these metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) involves seven stages. First, low-quality bases, along with adapter and host sequences, are removed. Second, overlapping sequences are assembled to create longer contiguous fragments. Third, these fragments are clustered based on sequence composition and abundance. Fourth, these sequence clusters, or bins, undergo rounds of quality assessment and refinement to yield MAGs. The optional fifth stage is dereplication of MAGs to select representatives. Next, each MAG is taxonomically classified. The optional seventh stage is assessing the fraction of diversity that has been recovered. The output of this protocol is draft genomes, which can provide invaluable clues about uncultured organisms. This protocol takes ~1 week to run, depending on computational resources available, and requires prior experience with high-performance computing, shell script programming and Python.},

abstract = {Background Studies of shifts in microbial community composition has many applications. For studies at species or subspecies levels, the 16S amplicon sequencing lacks resolution and is often replaced by full shotgun sequencing. Due to higher costs, this restricts the number of samples sequenced. As an alternative to a full shotgun sequencing we have investigated the use of Reduced Metagenome Sequencing (RMS) to estimate the composition of a microbial community. This involves the use of double-digested restriction-associated DNA sequencing, which means only a smaller fraction of the genomes are sequenced. The read sets obtained by this approach have properties different from both amplicon and shotgun data, and analysis pipelines for both can either not be used at all or not explore the full potential of RMS data. Results We suggest a procedure for analyzing such data, based on fragment clustering and the use of a constrained ordinary least square de-convolution for estimating the relative abundance of all community members. Mock community datasets show the potential to clearly separate strains even when the 16S is 100% identical, and genome-wide differences is < 0.02, indicating RMS has a very high resolution. From a simulation study, we compare RMS to shotgun sequencing and show that we get improved abundance estimates when the community has many very closely related genomes. From a real dataset of infant guts, we show that RMS is capable of detecting a strain diversity gradient for Escherichia coli across time. Conclusion We find that RMS is a good alternative to either metabarcoding or shotgun sequencing when it comes to resolving microbial communities at the strain level. Like shotgun metagenomics, it requires a good database of reference genomes and is well suited for studies of the human gut or other communities where many reference genomes exist.

abstract = {BioHansel performs high-resolution genotyping of bacterial isolates by identifying phylogenetically informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), also known as canonical SNPs, in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. The application uses a fast k-mer matching algorithm to map pathogen WGS data to canonical SNPs contained in hierarchically structured schemas and assigns genotypes based on the detected SNP profile. Using modest computing resources, BioHansel efficiently types isolates from raw sequence reads or assembled contigs in a matter of seconds, making it attractive for use by public health, food safety, environmental, and agricultural authorities that wish to apply WGS methodologies for their surveillance, diagnostics, and research programs. BioHansel currently provides canonical SNP genotyping schemas for four prevalent Salmonella serovars—Typhi, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Heidelberg—as well as a schema for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Users can also supply their own schemas for genotyping other organisms. BioHansel’s quality assurance system assesses the validity of the genotyping results and can identify low quality data, contaminated datasets, and misidentified organisms. BioHansel is targeted to support surveillance, source attribution, risk assessment, diagnostics, and rapid screening for public health purposes, such as product recalls. BioHansel is an open source application with packages available for PyPI, Conda, and the Galaxy workflow manager. In summary, BioHansel performs efficient, rapid, accurate, and high-resolution classification of bacterial genomes from sequence reads or assembled contigs on standard computing hardware. BioHansel is suitable for use as a general research tool as well as in fully operationalized WGS workflows at the front lines of infectious disease surveillance, diagnostics, and outbreak investigation and response. Impact statement Public health, food safety, environmental, and agricultural authorities are currently engaged in a global effort to incorporate whole genome sequencing technologies into their infectious disease research, surveillance, and outbreak investigation programs. Its widespread adoption, however, has been impeded by two major obstacles: the need for high performance computing to generate results and the expert knowledge required to interpret and communicate those results. BioHansel addresses these limitations by rapidly genotyping pathogens from whole genome sequence data in an accurate, simple, familiar, and easily sharable manner using standard computing resources. BioHansel provides a compact and readily interpretable genotype based on canonical SNP genotyping schemas. BioHansel’s genotyping nomenclature encodes the pathogen’s position in its population structure, which simplifies and facilitates its comparison with actively circulating strains and historical strains. The genotyping information provided by BioHansel can identify points of intervention to prevent the spread of pathogenic bacteria, screen for the presence of priority pathogens, and perform source attribution and risk assessment. Thus, BioHansel serves as a readily accessible and powerful WGS method, implementable on a laptop, for genotyping pathogens to detect, monitor, and control the emergence and spread of infectious disease through surveillance, screening, diagnostics, and outbreak investigation and response activities.

ABSTRACT Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) expand our understanding of microbial diversity, evolution, and ecology. Concerns have been raised on how sequencing, assembly, binning, and quality assessment tools may result in MAGs that do not reflect single populations in nature. Here, we reflect on another issue, i.e., how to handle highly similar MAGs assembled from independent data sets. Obtaining multiple genomic representatives for a species is highly valuable, as it allows for population genomic analyses; however, when retaining genomes of closely related populations, it complicates MAG quality assessment and abundance inferences. We show that (i) published data sets contain a large fraction of MAGs sharing >99% average nucleotide identity, (ii) different software packages and parameters used to resolve this redundancy remove very different numbers of MAGs, and (iii) the removal of closely related genomes leads to losses of population-specific auxiliary genes. Finally, we highlight some approaches that can infer strain-specific dynamics across a sample series without dereplication.},

abstract = {Viral metagenomics is increasingly being applied in clinical diagnostic settings for detection of pathogenic viruses. While a number of benchmarking studies have been published on the use of metagenomic classifiers for abundance and diversity profiling of bacterial populations, studies on the comparative performance of the classifiers for virus pathogen detection are scarce. In this study, metagenomic data sets (N=88) from a clinical cohort of patients with respiratory complaints were used for comparison of the performance of five taxonomic classifiers: Centrifuge, Clark, Kaiju, Kraken2, and Genome Detective. A total of 1,144 positive and negative PCR results for a total of 13 respiratory viruses were used as gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity of these classifiers ranged from 83-100% and 90-99% respectively, and was dependent on the classification level and data pre-processing. Exclusion of human reads generally resulted in increased specificity. Normalization of read counts for genome length resulted in minor overall performance, however negatively affected the detection of targets with read counts around detection level. Correlation of sequence read counts with PCR Ct-values varied per classifier, data pre-processing (R2 range 15.1-63.4%), and per virus, with outliers up to 3 log10 reads magnitude beyond the predicted read count for viruses with high sequence diversity. In this benchmarking study, sensitivity and specificity were within the ranges of use for diagnostic practice when the cut-off for defining a positive result was considered per classifier.},

abstract = {There is little consensus in the literature as to which approach for classification of Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequences is best. In this paper, we examine two of the most popular algorithms, Kraken2 and Metaphlan2 utilizing four publicly available datasets. As expected from previous literature, we found that Kraken2 reports more overall taxa while Metaphlan2 reports fewer taxa while classifying fewer overall reads. To our surprise, however, Kraken 2 reported not only more taxa but many more taxa that were significantly associated with metadata. This implies that either Kraken2 is more sensitive to taxa that are biologically relevant and are simply missed by Metaphlan2, or that Kraken2’s classification errors are generated in such a way to impact inference. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we compared Spearman correlations coefficients of each taxa against each taxa with higher abundance from the same dataset. We found that Kraken2, but not Metaphlan2, showed a consistent pattern of classifying low abundance taxa that generated high correlation coefficients with higher abundance taxa. Neither Metaphlan2, nor 16S sequences that were available for two of our four datasets, showed this pattern. Simple simulations based on a variable Poisson error rate sampled from the uniform distribution with an average error rate of 0.0005 showed strikingly strong concordance with the observed correlation patterns from Kraken2. Our results suggest that Kraken2 consistently misclassifies high abundance taxa into the same erroneous low abundance taxa creating “phantom” taxa have a similar pattern of inference as the high abundance source. Because of the large sequencing depths of modern WGS cohorts, these “phantom” taxa will appear statistically significant in statistical models even with a low overall rate of classification error from Kraken. Our simulations suggest that this can occur with average error rates as low as 1 in 2,000 reads. These data suggest a novel metric for evaluating classifier accuracy and suggest that the pattern of classification errors should be considered in addition to overall classification error rate since consistent classification errors have a more profound impact on inference compared to classification errors that do not always result in assignment to the same erroneous taxa. This work highlights fundamental questions on how classifiers function and interact with large sequencing depth and statistical models that still need to be resolved for WGS, especially if correlation coefficients between taxa are to be used to build covariance networks. Our work also suggests that despite its limitations, 16S rRNA sequencing may still be useful as neither of the two most popular 16S classifiers showed these patterns of inflated correlation coefficients between taxa.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Microbiome analyses of clinical samples with low microbial biomass are challenging because of the very small quantities of microbial DNA relative to the human host, ubiquitous contaminating DNA in sequencing experiments, and the large and rapidly growing microbial reference databases.


RESULTS
We present CSMD, a bioinformatics pipeline specifically developed to generate accurate species-level microbiome profiles for clinical samples with low microbial loads. CSMD applies strategies for the maximal elimination of host sequences with minimal loss of microbial signal and effectively detects microorganisms present in the sample with minimal false positives using a stepwise convergent solution. CSMD was benchmarked in a comparative evaluation with other classic tools on previously published well-characterized datasets. It showed higher sensitivity and specificity in host sequence removal and higher specificity in microbial identification, which led to more accurate abundance estimation. All these features are integrated into a free and easy-to-use tool. Additionally, CSMD applied to cell-free plasma DNA showed that microbial diversity within these samples is substantially broader than previously believed.

abstract = {The ability to detect the identity of a sample obtained from its environment is a cornerstone of molecular ecological research. Thanks to the falling price of shotgun sequencing, genome skimming, the acquisition of short reads spread across the genome at low coverage, is emerging as an alternative to traditional barcoding. By obtaining far more data across the whole genome, skimming has the promise to increase the precision of sample identification beyond traditional barcoding while keeping the costs manageable. While methods for assembly-free sample identification based on genome skims are now available, little is known about how these methods react to the presence of DNA from organisms other than the target species. In this paper, we show that the accuracy of distances computed between a pair of genome skims based on k-mer similarity can degrade dramatically if the skims include contaminant reads; i.e., any reads originating from other organisms. We establish a theoretical model of the impact of contamination. We then suggest and evaluate a solution to the contamination problem: Query reads in a genome skim against an extensive database of possible contaminants (e.g., all microbial organisms) and filter out any read that matches. We evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy when implemented using Kraken-II, in detailed analyses. Our results show substantial improvements in accuracy as a result of filtering but also point to limitations, including a need for relatively close matches in the contaminant database.},

abstract = {Despite its clinical importance, detection of highly divergent or yet unknown viruses is a major challenge. When human samples are sequenced, conventional alignments classify many assembled contigs as “unknown” since many of the sequences are not similar to known genomes. In this work, we developed ViraMiner, a deep learning-based method to identify viruses in various human biospecimens. ViraMiner contains two branches of Convolutional Neural Networks designed to detect both patterns and pattern-frequencies on raw metagenomics contigs. The training dataset included sequences obtained from 19 metagenomic experiments which were analyzed and labeled by BLAST. The model achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to other machine learning methods for viral genome classification. Using 300 bp contigs ViraMiner achieves 0.923 area under the ROC curve. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning methodology that can detect the presence of viral sequences among raw metagenomic contigs from diverse human samples. We suggest that the proposed model captures different types of information of genome composition, and can be used as a recommendation system to further investigate sequences labeled as “unknown” by conventional alignment methods. Exploring these highly-divergent viruses, in turn, can enhance our knowledge of infectious causes of diseases.},

abstract = {The gut microbiome is associated with human diseases and interacts with dietary components and drugs. In vivo mouse models may be effective for studying diet and drug effects on the gut microbiome. We constructed a mouse reference gut microbiome (MRGM, https://www.mbiomenet.org/MRGM/) that includes newly-assembled genomes from 878 metagenomes. Leveraging samples with ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing (>130 million read pairs), we demonstrated quality improvement in assembled genomes for mouse gut microbes as sequencing depth increased. MRGM provides a catalog of 46,267 non-redundant genomes with ≥70% completeness and ≤5% contamination comprising 1,689 representative bacterial species and 15.2 million non-redundant proteins. Importantly, MRGM significantly improved the taxonomic classification rate of sequencing reads from mouse fecal samples compared to previous databases. Using MRGM, we determined that reliable low-abundance taxa profiles of the mouse gut microbiome require sequencing >10 million reads. Despite the high overall functional similarity of the mouse and human gut microbiomes, only ~10% of MRGM species are shared with the human gut microbiome. Although ~80% of MRGM genera are present in the human gut microbiome, ~70% of the shared genera have <40% of core gene content for the respective genus with human counterparts. These suggest that although metabolic processes of the human gut microbiome largely occur in the mouse gut microbiome, functional translations between them according to genus-level taxonomic commonality require caution. Key Points MRGM provides 46,267 genomes comprising 1,689 bacterial species of mouse gut microbiome. Despite high overlap of genera, functional discrepancy between mouse and human gut microbiota is large. Lineage-specific markers underestimate the completeness of assembled genomes for uncharacterized taxa.},

abstract = {Background It is a computational challenge for current metagenomic classifiers to keep up with the pace of training data generated from genome sequencing projects, such as the exponentially-growing NCBI RefSeq bacterial genome database. When new reference sequences are added to training data, statically trained classifiers must be rerun on all data, resulting in a highly inefficient process. The rich literature of “incremental learning” addresses the need to update an existing classifier to accommodate new data without sacrificing much accuracy compared to retraining the classifier with all data. Results We demonstrate how classification improves over time by incrementally training a classifier on progressive RefSeq snapshots and testing it on: (a) all known current genomes (as a ground truth set) and (b) a real experimental metagenomic gut sample. We demonstrate that as a classifier model’s knowledge of genomes grows, classification accuracy increases. The proof-of-concept naïve Bayes implementation, when updated yearly, now runs in 1/4 t h of the non-incremental time with no accuracy loss. Conclusions It is evident that classification improves by having the most current knowledge at its disposal. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to make classifiers computationally tractable to keep up with the data deluge. The incremental learning classifier can be efficiently updated without the cost of reprocessing nor the access to the existing database and therefore save storage as well as computation resources.},

abstract = {BackgroundAn open challenge in translational bioinformatics is the analysis of sequenced metagenomes from various environmental samples. Of course, several studies demonstrated the 16S ribosomal RNA could be considered as a barcode for bacteria classification at the genus level, but till now it is hard to identify the correct composition of metagenomic data from RNA-seq short-read data. 16S short-read data are generated using two next generation sequencing technologies, i.e. whole genome shotgun (WGS) and amplicon (AMP); typically, the former is filtered to obtain short-reads belonging to a 16S shotgun (SG), whereas the latter take into account only some specific 16S hypervariable regions. The above mentioned two sequencing technologies, SG and AMP, are used alternatively, for this reason in this work we propose a deep learning approach for taxonomic classification of metagenomic data, that can be employed for both of them.ResultsTo test the proposed pipeline, we simulated both SG and AMP short-reads, from 1000 16S full-length sequences. Then, we adopted a k-mer representation to map sequences as vectors into a numerical space. Finally, we trained two different deep learning architecture, i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep belief network (DBN), obtaining a trained model for each taxon. We tested our proposed methodology to find the best parameters configuration, and we compared our results against the classification performances provided by a reference classifier for bacteria identification, known as RDP classifier. We outperformed the RDP classifier at each taxonomic level with both architectures. For instance, at the genus level, both CNN and DBN reached 91.3% of accuracy with AMP short-reads, whereas RDP classifier obtained 83.8% with the same data.ConclusionsIn this work, we proposed a 16S short-read sequences classification technique based on k-mer representation and deep learning architecture, in which each taxon (from phylum to genus) generates a classification model. Experimental results confirm the proposed pipeline as a valid approach for classifying bacteria sequences; for this reason, our approach could be integrated into the most common tools for metagenomic analysis. According to obtained results, it can be successfully used for classifying both SG and AMP data.},

We further demonstrated that the accuracy of species classification was substantially increased using the Microba Genome Database, which is more comprehensive than reference datasets used by other classifiers and illustrates the importance of including genomes of uncultured taxa in reference databases. Consequently, MCP classifies appreciably more reads than other classifiers when using their recommended reference databases.

abstract = {Coherent genomic groups are frequently used as a proxy for bacterial species delineation through computation of overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI). Average nucleotide identity (ANI) is a widely employed method for estimating relatedness between genomic sequences. However, pairwise comparisons of genome sequences based on ANI is relatively computationally intensive and therefore precludes analyses of large datasets composed of thousand genome sequences. In this work we evaluated an alternative OGRI based on k-mers counts to study prokaryotic species delimitation. A dataset containing more than 3,500 Pseudomonas genome sequences was successfully classified in few hours with the same precision as ANI. A new visualization method based on zoomable circle packing was employed for assessing relationships between among the 350 cliques generated. Amendment of databases with these Pseudomonas cliques greatly improved the classification of metagenomic read sets with k-mers-based classifier. The developed workflow was integrated in the user-friendly KI-S tool that is available at the following address: https://iris.angers.inra.fr/galaxypub-cfbp.},

abstract = {Computational methods are key in microbiome research, and obtaining a quantitative and unbiased performance estimate is important for method developers and applied researchers. For meaningful comparisons between methods, to identify best practices and common use cases, and to reduce overhead in benchmarking, it is necessary to have standardized datasets, procedures and metrics for evaluation. In this tutorial, we describe emerging standards in computational meta-omics benchmarking derived and agreed upon by a larger community of researchers. Specifically, we outline recent efforts by the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) initiative, which supplies method developers and applied researchers with exhaustive quantitative data about software performance in realistic scenarios and organizes community-driven benchmarking challenges. We explain the most relevant evaluation metrics for assessing metagenome assembly, binning and profiling results, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to generate them. The instructions use simulated mouse gut metagenome data released in preparation for the second round of CAMI challenges and showcase the use of a repository of tool results for CAMI datasets. This tutorial will serve as a reference for the community and facilitate informative and reproducible benchmarking in microbiome research.},

abstract = {Motivation Inferring properties of biological sequences--such as determining the species-of-origin of a DNA sequence or the function of an amino-acid sequence--is a core task in many bioinformatics applications. These tasks are often solved using string-matching to map query sequences to labeled database sequences or via Hidden Markov Model-like pattern matching. In the current work we describe and assess a deep learning approach which trains a deep neural network (DNN) to predict database-derived labels directly from query sequences. Results We demonstrate this DNN performs at state-of-the-art or above levels on a difficult, practically important problem: predicting species-of-origin from short reads of 16S ribosomal DNA. When trained on 16S sequences of over 13,000 distinct species, our DNN achieves read-level species classification accuracy within 2.0% of perfect memorization of training data, and produces more accurate genus-level assignments for reads from held-out species than k-mer, alignment, and taxonomic binning baselines. Moreover, our models exhibit greater robustness than these existing approaches to increasing noise in the query sequences. Finally, we show that these DNNs perform well on experimental 16S mock community dataset. Overall, our results constitute a first step towards our long-term goal of developing a general-purpose deep learning approach to predicting meaningful labels from short biological sequences.

abstract = {Background Current taxonomic classification tools use exact string matching algorithms that are effective to tackle the data from the next generation sequencing technology. However, the unique error patterns in the third generation sequencing (TGS) technologies could reduce the accuracy of these programs. Results We developed a Classification tool using Discriminative K-mers and Approximate Matching algorithm (CDKAM). This approximate matching method was used for searching k-mers, which included two phases, a quick mapping phase and a dynamic programming phase. Simulated datasets as well as real TGS datasets have been tested to compare the performance of CDKAM with existing methods. We showed that CDKAM performed better in many aspects, especially when classifying TGS data with average length 1000–1500 bases. Conclusions CDKAM is an effective program with higher accuracy and lower memory requirement for TGS metagenome sequence classification. It produces a high species-level accuracy.},

These genomes encode >170 million protein sequences, which we collated in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalog. The UHGP more than doubles the number of gut proteins in comparison to those present in the Integrated Gene Catalog. More than 70% of the UHGG species lack cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP lack functional annotations. Intraspecies genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which are specific to individual human populations. The UHGG and UHGP collections will enable studies linking genotypes to phenotypes in the human gut microbiome. More than 200,000 gut prokaryotic reference genomes and the proteins they encode are collated, providing comprehensive resources for microbiome researchers.},

abstract = {Culture-independent metagenomic detection of microbial species has the potential to provide rapid and precise real-time diagnostic results. However, it is potentially limited by sequencing and classification errors. We use simulated and real-world data to benchmark rates of species misclassification using 100 reference genomes for each of ten common bloodstream pathogens and six frequent blood culture contaminants (n=1600). Simulating both with and without sequencing error for both the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms, we evaluated commonly used classification tools including Kraken2, Bracken, and Centrifuge, utilising mini (8GB) and standard (30-50GB) databases. Bracken with the standard database performed best, the median percentage of reads across both sequencing platforms identified correctly to the species level was 98.46% (IQR 93.0:99.3) [range 57.1:100]. For Kraken2 with a mini database, a commonly used combination, median species-level identification was 79.3% (IQR 39.1:88.8) [range 11.2:100]. Classification performance varied by species, with E. coli being more challenging to classify correctly (59.4% to 96.4% reads with correct species, varying by tool used). By filtering out shorter Nanopore reads (<3500bp) we found performance similar or superior to Illumina sequencing, despite higher sequencing error rates. Misclassification was more common when the misclassified species had a higher average nucleotide identity to the true species. Our findings highlight taxonomic misclassification of sequencing data occurs and varies by sequencing and analysis workflow. This “bioinformatic contamination” should be accounted for in metagenomic pipelines to ensure accurate results that can support clinical decision making. Importance Metagenomics may transform clinical microbiology by enabling more rapid species detection in a potentially unbiased manner and reducing reliance on culture-based approaches. However, it is still limited by ongoing challenges such as sequencing and classification software errors. In this study, we use simulated and real-world data to define the intrinsic rates of species misclassification that occur using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing platforms with commonly used taxonomic classification tools and databases. We quantify the extent of “bioinformatic contamination” arising from the classification process. This enables us to identify the best performing tools that maximize classification accuracy, and to suggest how taxonomic misclassification can be formally accounted for in clinical diagnostic workflows. Specifically, we specify thresholds for identifying or excluding polymicrobial infections in metagenomic samples, based on rates of misclassification of similar species, which might have clinical implications when treating infection.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in metagenomic binning, reconstruction of microbial species from metagenomics data remains challenging. Here we develop variational autoencoders for metagenomic binning (VAMB), a program that uses deep variational autoencoders to encode sequence coabundance and k -mer distribution information before clustering. We show that a variational autoencoder is able to integrate these two distinct data types without any previous knowledge of the datasets. VAMB outperforms existing state-of-the-art binners, reconstructing 29–98% and 45% more near-complete (NC) genomes on simulated and real data, respectively. Furthermore, VAMB is able to separate closely related strains up to 99.5% average nucleotide identity (ANI), and reconstructed 255 and 91 NC Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei sample-specific genomes as two distinct clusters from a dataset of 1,000 human gut microbiome samples. We use 2,606 NC bins from this dataset to show that species of the human gut microbiome have different geographical distribution patterns. VAMB can be run on standard hardware and is freely available at https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb .

abstract = {The number of microbial genome sequences is growing exponentially, also thanks to recent advances in recovering complete or near-complete genomes from metagenomes and single cells. Assigning reliable taxon labels to genomes is key and often a prerequisite for downstream analyses. We introduce CAMITAX, a scalable and reproducible workflow for the taxonomic labelling of microbial genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, and metagenomes. CAMI-TAX combines genome distance-, 16S rRNA gene-, and gene homology-based taxonomic assignments with phylogenetic placement. It uses Nextflow to orchestrate reference databases and software containers, and thus combines ease of installation and use with computational re-producibility. We evaluated the method on several hundred metagenome-assembled genomes with high-quality taxonomic annotations from the TARA Oceans project, and show that the ensemble classification method in CAMITAX improved on all individual methods across tested ranks. While we initially developed CAMITAX to aid the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) initiative, it evolved into a comprehensive software to reliably assign taxon labels to microbial genomes.
