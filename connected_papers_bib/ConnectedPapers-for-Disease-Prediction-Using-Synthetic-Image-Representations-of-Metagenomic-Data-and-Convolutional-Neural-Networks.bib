abstract = {Information from metagenomic data from human microbiome may improve diagnosis and prognosis for multiple human diseases. However, to achieve a prediction based on bacterial abundance information remains a challenge. Indeed, the number of features being much higher than the number of samples, we face difficulties related to high dimensional data processing, as well as overfitting. In this study, we investigate several convolutional neural network architectures for synthetic images and some experimental techniques to generate and train these synthetic images. We also explore supervised learning for visualizing high dimensional data that use data on genus, species and higher taxonomic level information. In addition, some dimensionality reduction approaches are examined on very high dimensional data such as gene families abundance. We evaluated our approach on six different metagenomic datasets including five types of diseases with more than 1000 samples. Our method displays promising results and can be used in different omics data settings, including integrative ones.},

abstract = {The tremendous boost in the next generation sequencing and in the omics technologies makes it possible to characterize human gut microbiome (the collective genomes of the microbial community that reside in our gastrointestinal tract). While some of these microorganisms are considered as essential regulators of our immune system, some others can cause several diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), diabetes, and cancer. IBD, is a gut related disorder where the deviations from the healthy gut microbiome are considered to be associated with IBD. Although existing studies attempt to unveal the composition of the gut microbiome in relation to IBD diseases, a comprehensive picture is far from being complete. Due to the complexity of metagenomic studies, the applications of the state of the art machine learning techniques became popular to address a wide range of questions in the field of metagenomic data analysis. In this regard, using IBD associated metagenomics dataset, this study utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, i) to generate a classification model that aids IBD diagnosis, ii) to discover IBD associated biomarkers, iii) to find subgroups of IBD patients using k means and hierarchical clustering. To deal with the high dimensionality of features, we applied robust feature selection algorithms such as Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (CMIM), Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF), min redundancy max relevance (mRMR) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). In our experiments with 10 fold cross validation, XGBoost had a considerable effect in terms of minimizing the microbiota used for the diagnosis of IBD and thus reducing the cost and time. We observed that compared to the single classifiers, ensemble methods such as kNN and logitboost resulted in better performance measures for the classification of IBD.},

abstract = {Scientific research is shedding more and more light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human body and its role in human health. Empirical evidence shows that the microbiome is strongly interconnected with the host immune system and can contribute to carcinogenesis. Furthermore, studies show that it can be used as a predictor for various diseases. In this work, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. Adopting an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks, MVIB allows to compute a joint stochastic encoding of the input data modalities, which acts as a minimal sufficient statistics of the inputs for the prediction of a target label. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA. Additionally, we perform transfer learning experiments by fine-tuning the model on the target disease dataset after a pre-training on all other source diseases, as well as cross-study generalisation experiments. Furthermore, we adopt a saliency technique to interpret the outcome of the model classification and identify which microbial species and strain-level markers mostly contribute to a certain prediction. The combination of metabolomic data to the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles is also investigated. We show that MVIB achieves competitive results on the microbiome-based disease prediction task and is very fast to train. Author summary The gut microbiome is strongly correlated with human health and can be used to predict various diseases. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning method which allows to efficiently combine heterogeneous data modalities by computing a joint stochastic encoding. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease and we shed light on which microbial species and gene markers contribute significantly to the prediction outcome. Specifically, we analyse species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA from ten different cohorts and obtain competitive classification performance on disease prediction. Furthermore, we adopt a method based on saliency to discover which microbial species and gene markers mostly contribute to the model prediction. Additionally, we perform experiments combining abundance and marker profiles with metabolomic data extracted from mass spectrometry. We show that MVIB can operate accurate microbiome-based disease prediction and is also very fast to train.},

The diversities of functional enzymes and corresponding genes were investigated in 50 days chicken manure composting through six treatments amended with six different dosage of clay in this study. The result revealed that the relative abundance of functional enzymes and related genes was distinctively different among all treatments. The addition of clay significantly enhanced the diversity of functional genes and enzymes at different levels in this study, similarity analysis also showed the different proportion of clay addition influence activity of functional genes and enzymes in varying degrees. The higher percentage of clay addition showed more significant promotion on dynamics of functional genes and enzymes. While, at six major functional level, the gene expression and related enzymatic activity was inhibited with addition of 10% clay. In conclusion, application of clay in chicken manure composting could effectively improve the relative abundance of functional genes and enzymes, so as to promote degradation of organic matter during composting.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have had unprecedented success when applied to images, waveforms, and texts to cite a few. In general, when the sample size (N) is much greater than the number of features (d), DL outperforms previous machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of convolution neural networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics ML tasks, we encounter the opposite situation where d is greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques (such as feed-forward networks) would lead to severe overfitting. Thus, sparse ML techniques (such as LASSO e.g.) usually yield the best results on these tasks. In this paper, we show how to apply CNNs on data which do not have originally an image structure (in particular on metagenomic data). Our first contribution is to show how to map metagenomic data in a meaningful way to 1D or 2D images. Based on this representation, we then apply a CNN, with the aim of predicting various diseases. The proposed approach is applied on six different datasets including in total over 1000 samples from various diseases. This approach could be a promising one for prediction tasks in the bioinformatics field.},

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.},

Conditional generative adversarial networks train two models against each other while leveraging side information learn from a given dataset to compute larger simulated datasets that are representative of the original dataset. In our study, we used a cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease to show that not only can the generative adversarial network generate samples representative of the original data based on multiple diversity metrics, but also that training machine learning models on the synthetic samples can improve disease prediction through data augmentation.

abstract = {Abstract Motivation The human body hosts more microbial organisms than human cells. Analysis of this microbial diversity provides key insight into the role played by these microorganisms on human health. Metagenomics is the collective DNA sequencing of coexisting microbial organisms in an environmental sample or a host. This has several applications in precision medicine, agriculture, environmental science and forensics. State-of-the-art predictive models for phenotype predictions from metagenomic data rely on alignments, assembly, extensive pruning, taxonomic profiling and reference sequence databases. These processes are time consuming and they do not consider novel microbial sequences when aligned with the reference genome, limiting the potential of whole metagenomics. We formulate the problem of predicting human disease from whole-metagenomic data using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a popular supervised learning paradigm. Our proposed alignment-free approach provides higher accuracy in prediction by harnessing the capability of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within a MIL framework and provides interpretability via neural attention mechanism. Results The MIL formulation combined with the hierarchical feature extraction capability of deep-CNN provides significantly better predictive performance compared to popular existing approaches. The attention mechanism allows for the identification of groups of sequences that are likely to be correlated to diseases providing the much-needed interpretation. Our proposed approach does not rely on alignment, assembly and reference sequence databases; making it fast and scalable for large-scale metagenomic data. We evaluate our method on well-known large-scale metagenomic studies and show that our proposed approach outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods for disease prediction.

Multiple methods exist for the association analysis. However, the results could be inconsistent, presenting challenges in interpreting the host-microbiome interactions.

Meta-Signer can rank taxa using two input forms of the data: the relative abundances of the original taxa and taxa from the populated taxonomic trees generated from the original taxa. The latter form allows the evaluation of the association of microbial features at different taxonomic levels to the disease, which is attributed to our novel model of PopPhy-CNN. Results We evaluate Mega-Signer on five different human gut-microbiome datasets. We demonstrate that the features derived from Meta-Signer were more informative compared to those obtained from other available feature ranking methods. The highly ranked features are strongly supported by published literature. Conclusion Meta-Signer is capable of deriving a robust set of microbial features at multiple taxonomic levels for the prediction of host phenotype.

Data are comprised of two parts: 1) shell image and molecular analyses of G. vrijenhoeki and 2) metagenomic community analyses of gill-associated symbiotic bacteria on G. vrijenhoeki. G. vrijenhoeki data were obtained from type specimens described in Jang et al. 2020 [1]. The molecular analysis was conducted by calculating genetic distance at intra- and inter-specific level within genus Gigantidas based on the sequence data of two mitochondrial genes (COI and ND4). The metagenomic dataset of gill-associated symbionts were generated by Illumina Miseq sequencing of the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA from 12 specimens of G. vrijenhoeki collected from the same vent site, Onnuri Vent Field.},

Visualizing metagenomic data is a challenge because of its complexity and high-dimensional. In this paper, we introduce several approaches based on dimensionality reduction algorithms and data density to visualize features which reflect the species abundance. The sophisticated methods used in this study, that are unsupervised approaches, carry out dimensionality reduction and map the data into a 2-dimensional space. From the visualizations obtained, deep learning techniques are leveraged to enhance the prediction performance for colorectal cancer. We show by experiments on five Metagenome-based colorectal cancer datasets from different regions such as Chinese, Austrian, American, German and French cohorts that the proposed visualizations allow to visualize bio-medical signatures and improve the prediction performance compared to classical machine learning.},

abstract = {Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

abstract = {With the recent technological advancement in cultivation-independent high-throughput sequencing, metagenomes have tremendously improved our ability to characterize the genomic contents of the whole microbial communities. In this chapter, we argue the notion of pangenome can be applied beyond the available genome sequences by leveraging metagenome-assembled genomes, to form a comprehensive representation of the genetic content of a taxonomic group in a particular environment. We present the concept of the meta-pangenome, a representation of the totality of genes belonging to a species identified in multiple metagenomic samplings of a particular habitat. As an essential component in genome-centric pangenome analyses, we emphasize the importance to perform stringent quality assessment and validation to ensure the high quality of metagenomic deconvoluted genomes. This expansion from the traditional pangenome concept to the meta-pangenome overcomes many of the biases associated with whole-genome sequencing, and addresses the in vivo ecological context to further develop a systems-level understanding of microbial ecosystems.},

abstract = {The major problem when analyzing a metagenomic sample is to taxonomically annotate its reads in order to identify the species they contain. Most of the methods currently available focus on the classification of reads using a set of reference genomes and their k-mers. While in terms of precision these methods have reached percentages of correctness close to perfection, in terms of recall (the actual number of classified reads) the performances fall at around 50%. One of the reasons is the fact that the sequences in a sample can be very different from the corresponding reference genome, e.g. viral genomes are highly mutated. To address this issue, in this paper we study the problem of metagenomic reads classification by improving the reference k-mers library with novel discriminative k-mers from the input sequencing reads. We evaluated the performance in different conditions against several other tools and the results showed an improved F-measure, especially when close reference genomes are not available.

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown unprecedented success when applied to images, waveforms, and text. Generally, when the sample size (N) is much bigger than the number of features (d), DL often out-performs other machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics fields (including metagenomics), we encounter the opposite situation where d is significantly greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques would lead to severe over-fitting. Here we aim to improve classification of various diseases with metagenomic data through the use of CNNs. For this we proposed to represent metagenomic data as images. The proposed Met2Img approach relies on taxonomic and t-SNE embeddings to transform abundance data into " synthetic images ". We applied our approach to twelve benchmark data sets including more than 1400 metagenomic samples. Our results show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). We observe that the integration of phylogenetic information alongside abundance data improves classification. The proposed approach is not only important in classification setting but also allows to visualize complex metagenomic data. The Met2Img is implemented in Python.},

abstract = {As the quest for performance confronts resource constraints, major breakthroughs in computing efficiency are expected to benefit from unconventional approaches and new models of computation such as brain-inspired computing. Beyond energy, the growing number of defects in physical substrates is becoming another major constraint that affects the design of computing devices and systems. Neural computing principles remain elusive, yet they are considered as the source of a promising paradigm to achieve fault-tolerant computation. Since the quest for fault tolerance can be translated into scalable and reliable computing systems, hardware design itself and the potential use of faulty circuits have motivated further the investigation on neural networks, which are potentially capable of absorbing some degrees of vulnerability based on their natural properties. In this paper, the fault tolerance properties of Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) are investigated. To asses the intrinsic fault tolerance and considering a general fully parallel digital implementations of SOM, we use the bit-flip fault model to inject faults in registers holding SOM weights. The distortion measure is used to evaluate performance on synthetic datasets and under different fault ratios. Additionally, we evaluate three passive techniques intended to enhance fault tolerance of SOM during training/learning under different scenarios.},
