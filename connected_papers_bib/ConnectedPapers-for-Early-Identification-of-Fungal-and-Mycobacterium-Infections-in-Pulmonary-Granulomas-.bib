abstract = {ABSTRACT Background The purpose of the study is to assess the etiology detection ability of Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) on formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) tissue from postoperative biopsy specimens. Methods We prospectively enrolled specimens from patients undergone surgery biopsy due to undefinite diagnosis and pathologically indicated granulomatous lesions. FFPE tissues were tested by mNGS and histopathology. The etiology detection rate of mNGS was calculated and compared with histopathology.. Results Among the 69 cases eventually included, 41 (59.42%) were diagnosed with infectious granuloma. The overall fungi and mycobacteria etiology detection rates of mNGS in granuloma lesions was 87.80% (36/41). The mNGS increased the detection rate by 68.29% (28/41) compared with histopathology, the difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 28.97, P = 0.00). The detection rates of mNGS in fungal infections (12/12,100%) and in mycobacterium infections (22/27, 81.48%) were significant higher than those of histopathology (8/12, 66.67% and 0/27, 0.00%; both P = 0.00). Two (2/2.100%) cases of co-infection were detected at one time by mNGS. All mNGS-based clinical decisions were made within 2 days. Conclusions The mNGS could accurately and quickly detect fungi and mycobacteria in FFPE specimens from postoperative granuloma specimens and identify the pathogens to the species level.

abstract = {Purpose This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic application and performance of the metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in patients suspected of local pulmonary infection by comparing it to the traditional pathogen detection methods in lung tissue specimens obtained by a computerized tomography-guided biopsy (CT-guided biopsy). Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients, admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, China from May 2018 to December 2020, who were suspected of local pulmonary infection. All cases received a CT-guided lung biopsy, tissue samples were sent both for conventional examinations (CE) and mNGS tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the two diagnostic approaches were compared. Results 106 patients enrolled, 76 patients were diagnosed with a pulmonary infection. Among 49 patients with identified pathogens, CE confirmed pathogenic infections in 32 cases. Mycobacterium spp. and fungi accounted for 37.5% (12/32) and 28.1% (9/32), respectively, with bacteria 34.4% (11/32). The mNGS examination detected extra pathogenic microorganisms in 22 patients that were consistent with the patients' clinical and radiographic pictures. The sensitivity of mNGS was 53.9% vs. 42.1% for the CE, while the specificity was 56.7% versus 96.7%. For detection rate, mNGS was significantly superior to CE in bacterial (96.3% vs. 40.7%, p  < 0.05), and mixed infections (100% vs. 50%, p  < 0.05), but inferior to CE in fungal (60% vs. 90%, p  > 0.05) and Mycobacterium spp. infections (66.7% vs. 100%, p  > 0.05) with no significant difference. Among 31 cases diagnosed with lung abscess, the diagnostic performance of the detection rate was 67.7% (21/31) in favour of mNGS compared to 29.0% (9/31) for CE ( p  < 0.05). Most polymicrobial infections were induced by anaerobic species that coexisted with Streptococcus constellatus . And Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common isolated monomicrobial infection. Conclusions The most commonly detected causative pathogens for local pulmonary infections were bacteria, Mycobacterium spp. and fungi. Compared with the CE, the advantages of mNGS in the pathogens detection lie in the discovery of bacterial and mixed infections, as well as in the detection of lung abscess. Conversely, mNGS is not good enough to be recommendable for the detection of Mycobacterium spp. and fungi.},

abstract = {The fight against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) has been going on for thousands of years, while it still poses a threat to human health. In addition to routine detections, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has begun to show presence as a comprehensive and hypothesis-free test. It can not only detect MTB without isolating specific pathogens but also suggest the co-infection pathogens or underlying tumor simultaneously, which is of benefit to assist in comprehensive clinical diagnosis. It also shows the potential to detect multiple drug resistance sites for precise treatment. However, considering the cost performance compared with conventional assays (especially Xpert MTB/RIF), mNGS seems to be overqualified for patients with mild and typical symptoms. Technology optimization of sequencing and analyzing should be conducted to improve the positive rate and broaden the applicable fields.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Metagenomic Next-generation Sequencing (mNGS) has been shown as an effective diagnostic method for infectious diseases, but its potential clinical utility for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis remains to be demonstrated.


METHODS
Three hundreds and twenty-two bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples collected from 311 suspected and confirmed pulmonary TB patients, were tested by mNGS, smear, Xpert® MTB/RIF (Xpert) and culture. The diagnostic performance of mNGS with conventional detection methods for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and other pathogens in BALF were compared. Additionally, the underlying factors associated with positive detection in pulmonary TB patients were investigated.


RESULTS
mNGS, Xpert and culture presented a high proportion of complete matching for MTBC detection (244/322, 75.8%). In the pulmonary TB patients before treatment, the sensitivity of MTBC detection by mNGS, Xpert, culture and smear was 59.9%(85/142), 69.0%(98/142), 59.9%(85/142) and 24.6%(35/142), respectively, and 79.6% overall, of which MTBC was detected by mNGS in 33.2% (5/34) Xpert and culture-negative samples. The positive MTBC detection by mNGS was affected by Vitamin D, ESR, TB initial treatment/retreatment and cavity in chest imaging (χ2 = 37.42, P < 0.001), but not by prior anti-TB usage within three months. mNGS was able to detect new potential pathogens in 8.7% (28/322) of samples.


CONCLUSIONS
Combined with mNGS based on conventional detection methods could increase the detection rate of MTBC. Additionally, mNGS could identify pathogens in a non-targeted approach for the better diagnosis of coinfection.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infections in people living with HIV (PLWH) in real-world situation.


METHODS
We send CSF to mNGS for PLWH who tested negative by all the conventional tests, but still suspected of CNS infections. We performed a retrospective analysis of the results and their clinical effect of mNGS on this cohort. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel discussion after patient's discharge when the results of all the tests and patients' response to the empiric therapy were available.


RESULTS
Eighty-eight eligible PLWH, including 58.0%(51/88) suspected of encephalitis and 46.7%(34/88) suspected of meningitis were included in the analysis. 77.3% (68/88) were diagnosed with CNS infections, among which 50 were based on the pathogens identified by mNGS. The most common diseases that mNGS missed were clinically suspected tuberculosis meningitis, followed by clinically suspected nontuberculous mycobacterial meningitis. The results from mNGS led to the modification of treatment in 23.9% (21/88) patients, while they increased confidence in maintaining original therapy in 34.1% (30/88). During hospitalization, total mortality was 2.3% (2/88) while 75% (66/88) of patients improved.


CONCLUSIONS
The CSF clinical mNGS is a useful tool in diagnosing CNS infections among PLWH. Further investigations are warranted to improve its sensitivity.},

abstract = {Objective To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples or lung biopsy specimens from which suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients have no sputum or negative smear. Materials and Methods Sputum-scarce or smear-negative cases with suspected PTB (n = 107) were analyzed from January 2018 to June 2020. We collected BALF or lung tissue biopsy samples with these cases of suspected TB during hospitalization. The diagnostic accuracy of mNGS for these samples was compared with those of conventional tests or the T-SPOT.TB assay. Results 46 cases of PTB patients and 61 cases of non-PTB patients were finally enrolled and analyzed. mNGS exhibited a sensitivity of 89.13%, which was higher than conventional tests (67.39%) but equivalent to those of the T-SPOT.TB assay alone (76.09%) or T-SPOT.TB assay in combination with conventional tests (91.30%). The specificity of mNGS was 98.36%, similar to conventional tests (95.08%) but significantly higher than those of the T-SPOT.TB assay alone (65.57%) or the T-SPOT.TB assay in combination with conventional tests (63.93%). There was no significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy of mNGS in BALF samples and lung biopsy tissue specimens. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that mNGS could offer improved detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in BALF or lung tissue biopsy samples in sputum-scarce or smear-negative cases with suspected PTB.},

The current study aimed to assess the accuracy of metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) for TBM, and to identify a new test for the early diagnosis of TBM. Methods We searched for articles published in Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data up to June 30, 2020 for studies that assessed the efficacy of mNGS for the diagnosis of TBM. Then, the accuracy between mNGS and a composite reference standard (CRS) in these articles was compared using the meta-analysis approach. Results Four independent studies with 342 samples comparing mNGS and a CRS were included in this study. The sensitivity of mNGS for TBM diagnosis ranged from 27% to 84%. The combined sensitivity of mNGS was 61%, and the I2 value was 92%. Moreover, the specificity of mNGS for TBM diagnosis ranged from 96% to 100%. The combined specificity of mNGS was 98%, and the I2 value was 74%. The heterogeneity between studies in terms of sensitivity and specificity was significant. The area under the curve (AUC) of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) of mNGS for TBM was 0.98. Conclusions The sensitivity of mNGS for TBM diagnosis was moderate. Furthermore, the specificity was extremely high, and the AUC of the SROC indicated a very good diagnostic efficacy. mNGS could be used as an early diagnostic method for TBM, however, the results should be treated with caution for the heterogeneity between studies was extremely significant.

abstract = {Aims The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in detecting pathogens from synovial fluid of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) patients. Methods A group of 75 patients who underwent revision knee or hip arthroplasties were enrolled prospectively. Ten patients with primary arthroplasties were included as negative controls. Synovial fluid was collected for mNGS analysis. Optimal thresholds were determined to distinguish pathogens from background microbes. Synovial fluid, tissue, and sonicate fluid were obtained for culture. Results A total of 49 PJI and 21 noninfection patients were finally included. Of the 39 culture-positive PJI cases, mNGS results were positive in 37 patients (94.9%), and were consistent with culture results at the genus level in 32 patients (86.5%) and at the species level in 27 patients (73.0%). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing additionally identified 15 pathogens from five culture-positive and all ten culture-negative PJI cases, and even one pathogen from one noninfection patient, while yielding no positive findings in any primary arthroplasty. However, seven pathogens identified by culture were missed by mNGS. The sensitivity of mNGS for diagnosing PJI was 95.9%, which was significantly higher than that of comprehensive culture (79.6%; p = 0.014). The specificity is similar between mNGS and comprehensive culture (95.2% and 95.2%, respectively; p = 1.0). Conclusion Metagenomic next-generation sequencing can effectively identify pathogens from synovial fluid of PJI patients, and demonstrates high accuracy in diagnosing PJI.

abstract = {Background Metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been increasingly used in the clinic, which provides a powerful tool for the etiological diagnosis of infectious diseases. Precise treatment can be carried out according to the positive mNGS results. However, the role of negative results of mNGS remains poorly defined in clinical practice. Methods The results of 1,021 samples from patients who received the mNGS test at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, between January 2019 and December 2019 were analyzed. Results There were 308 samples (30.17%) of negative results included in the current study. The top 2 types of negative samples were blood (130/308) and tissue (63/308), which also accounted for the highest negative proportion in diseases. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were more likely to have positive results. In false-negative results (defined as negative in mNGS test but reported positive in other sample types or assays), 118 samples were found when compared to regular microbiological assays. The negative predictive value (NPV) of mNGS was 95.79% [95%CI, 93.8%–97.8%] as compared to culture and smear. Mycobacterium, Aspergillus, and Mycoplasma ranked as the top 3 microorganisms on the undetected pathogen list. Conclusions The present data indicate that when the mNGS test is negative, the negative prediction accuracy rate of the original specimen is significant. However, other laboratory assays results and clinical presentations should always be carefully considered prior to drawing a diagnosis.},

Methods Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 197 HIV-negative patients with suspected central nervous system infections were tested simultaneously by mNGS and routine methods [India ink staining, fungal culture, or cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) tests]. The performance of mNGS was evaluated. Results Of the 197 enrolled cases, 46 (23.4%) cases were finally diagnosed with CM, including 43 (93.5%) Cryptococcus neoformans infections and 3 (6.5%) Cryptococcus gattii infections. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and concordance rate of mNGS were 93.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) at 86.4%~100.0%], 96.0% (95% CI at 92.9%~99.1%), 87.8%, 98.0%, and 95.4%, respectively. Comparing to the conventional diagnostic methods, the sensitivity and concordance rate of mNGS were slightly lower than those of CrAg tests (97.4%) but higher than those of India ink (63.0%) and culture (76.7%). Besides, mNGS had a sensitivity of 100.0% against culture. It should be noted that mNGS could identify Cryptococcus at species level; C. gattii of the 3 cases was only distinguished by mNGS. Conclusions CSF mNGS can be considered as a supplementary test to diagnose CM and directly distinguish C. gattii from C. neoformans in clinical specimens.},

This study aimed to compare mNGS results from lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and determine their clinical diagnostic efficacy. Patients and Methods A total of 106 patients with suspected pulmonary fungal infection from May 2018 to January 2020 were included in this retrospective study. All patients’ lung biopsy and BALF specimens were collected through bronchoscopy. Overall, 45 (42.5%) patients had pulmonary fungal infection. The performance of lung biopsy and BALF used for mNGS in diagnosing pulmonary fungal infections and identifying pathogens was compared. Additionally, mNGS was compared with conventional tests (pathology, galactomannan test, and cultures) with respect to the diagnosis of pulmonary fungal infections. Results Lung biopsy-mNGS and BALF-mNGS exhibited no difference in terms of sensitivity (80.0% vs 84.4%, P=0.754) and specificity (91.8% vs 85.3%, P=0.39). Additionally, there was no difference in specificity between mNGS and conventional tests; however, the sensitivity of mNGS (lung biopsy, BALF) in diagnosing pulmonary fungal infections was significantly higher than that of conventional tests (conventional tests vs biopsy-mNGS: 44.4% vs 80.0%, P<0.05; conventional tests vs BALF-mNGS: 44.4% vs 84.4%, P<0.05). Among 32 patients with positive mNGS results for both biopsy and BALF specimens, 23 (71.9%) cases of consistency between the two tests for the detected fungi and nine (28.1%) cases of a partial match were identified. Receiver operating curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve for the combination of biopsy and BALF was significantly higher than that for BALF-mNGS (P=0.018). Conclusion We recommend biopsy-based or BALF-based mNGS for diagnosing pulmonary fungal infections because of their diagnostic advantages over conventional tests. The combination of biopsy and BALF for mNGS can be considered when higher diagnostic efficacy is required.},

abstract = {Disseminated tuberculosis (TB) is a rare disease and mainly occurs in immunodeficient patients. It is marked by hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causing tuberculous infection involving any organ system. Here, we report a case of disseminated TB involving lung, liver, spine, mediastinum, and prostate in an immunocompetent man. The present patient found a hepatic mass without any symptom during health examination. In the next 2 years, further examinations revealed multiple lesions in the lung, mediastinum, spine, and prostate. Imaging examinations, such as contrast-enhanced abdominal CT, F-18 FDG-PET/CT, and radionuclide bone scan, suggested the diagnosis of malignancy or metastatic tumor. Furthermore, histopathological results of the biopsies of the hepatic mass, mediastinal mass, and prostatic mass demonstrated granulomatous inflammation. Therefore, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was utilized to confirm the diagnosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was simultaneously detected in the spinal surgical resection specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), indicating the diagnosis of disseminated TB. mNGS is an emerging molecular diagnostic technology, and its application in disseminated TB has been rarely reported. We highlight that disseminated TB should be considered even in an immunocompetent patient, and mNGS can be performed when the diagnosis is difficult.},

abstract = {Background To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for active tuberculosis (TB). Methods We retrospectively collected 820 samples at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University in Shanghai, China, between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. They were classified into TB cases (125, 15.2%) and NOT TB cases (695, 84.8%) according to the clinical diagnosis. Specimens were evaluated by a regular clinical microbiological assay and mNGS performed in parallel. Results Sixty-one confirmed TB cases and 64 clinical TB cases were included. The overall sensitivity of mNGS was 49.6% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 40.6–58.6%], and the specificity was 98.3% (95% CI, 96.9–99.1%), with peak sensitivities of 88.9% (95% CI, 50.7–99.4%) for lung tissue, 55.0% (95% CI, 32.0–76.2%) for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and 50.0% (95% CI, 32.8–67.2%) for serous fluids. The overall sensitivity of mNGS was superior to that of the culture assay (35.2%, 95% CI, 27.0–44.3), but no superior sensitivity for sputum was observed in mNGS compared with the culture assay (mNGS: 52.3%, 95% CI, 31.1–72.6%; culture: 60.9%, 95% CI, 38.8–79.5%). In clinical TB cases, mNGS detected additional positive results (40.6%, 26/64). mNGS reduced the turnaround time from 2–6 weeks to 32–36 hours. Conclusions mNGS may be a promising technology for the early auxiliary diagnosis of active TB, especially sputum-negative pulmonary TB (PTB) and tuberculous serous effusion.},

 Background: To evaluate the diagnostic value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in immunocompromised patients for the diagnosis of suspected pneumonia in comparation to that of conventional microbiological tests (CMTs).Methods: Sixty-nine immunocompromised patients with suspected pneumonia received both CMTs and mNGS of BALF were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnostic value was compared between CMTs and mNGS, using the clinical composite diagnosis as the reference standard. Results: Sixty patients were diagnosed of pneumonia including fifty-two patients with identified pathogens and eight patients with probable pathogens. The overall detection rate of mNGS for pathogens were higher than that of CMTs. However, a comparable diagnostic accuracy of mNGS and CMTs were found for bacterial and viral infections. mNGS exhibited a higher diagnostic accuracy for fungal detection than CMTs (78% vs. 54%, P＜0.05), which mainly because of the high sensitivity of mNGS in patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) (100% vs. 28%, P＜0.05). Among fifty-two patients with definite pathogens, nineteen patients (37%) were identified as pulmonary mixed infection, mNGS test showed a higher detection rate and broader spectrum for pathogen detection than that of CMTs in mixed infection. Moreover, Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common pathogen in mix infection and mNGS have identified much more co-pathogens of PJP than CMTs.Conclusions: mNGS of BALF improved the microbial detection rate of pathogens and exhibited remarkable advantages in detecting PJP and identifying mixed infections in immunocompromised patients.},

Its main clinical manifestation is fever with thrombocytopenia, which may be accompanied by other clinical symptoms. Here, we report a patient diagnosed with SFTS using metagenomic next‑generation sequencing (mNGS). Case Presentation A 56-year-old female patient was hospitalized with intermittent diarrhea and fever. She visited a local clinic for treatment, but instead of improving, the symptoms progressed to unconsciousness. Diagnosis Using mNGS, we isolated the bunyaviridae virus and several other pathogens from the patient’s blood samples to confirm the diagnosis. Interventions The patient was treated with symptomatic and supportive therapy, including intravenous human γ-globulin (20 g/d), platelet transfusion, platelet elevation (subcutaneous injection of recombinant human thrombopoietin, 15,000 IU), white blood cell elevation (subcutaneous injection of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, 200 ug, qd); and antibiotic (cefoperazone sodium and tazobactam sodium, 2 g, q8h), antiviral (ganciclovir, 250 mg, q12h), and antifungal therapy (voriconazole for injection, 0.2 g, q12h). After ten days of treatment, the patient’s condition gradually improved. Conclusion Compared to traditional detection methods, mNGS has many advantages. It can quickly identify the pathogen when the patient’s clinical manifestations are complex and difficult to diagnose, resulting in the formulation of an effective treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
To assess the value of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in early diagnosis of patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM).


METHODS
56 patients with clinically suspected TBM who came to Shandong Provincial Chest Hospital from February 2, 2018 to August 2, 2018 were prospectively included, and the clinical diagnosis and treatment outcomes were followed up. NGS was performed for the cerebrospinal fluid specimens submitted for test on the BGISEQ-100 platform of Tianjin Huada Gene Research Institute and the obtained pathogen sequences were compared with the pathogen data to get the final results. The NGS results were positive for detecting the unique matching sequence of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex and negative for no unique matching sequence. Patients confirmed with TBM should have at least one of the following four items: cerebrospinal fluid MTB culture positive, smear positive, Xpert MTB/RIF test positive, or MTB nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test positive; clinically diagnosed patients were those with clinically suspected TBM and effective anti-tuberculosis treatment; non-TBM patients were those with other pathogenic basis or clinical exclusion of TBM. The sensitivity and specificity of NGS in early diagnosis of TBM were analyzed.


RESULTS
22 patients were confirmed with TBM, of which 13 were positive for Xpert MTB/RIF test, 6 were positive for cerebrospinal fluid MTB culture, 5 were positive for MTB nucleic acid PCR test, 12 patients were clinically diagnosed with TBM, and there were 16 cases of non-TBM patients. Among confirmed and clinically diagnosed patients, 20 cases of MTB complex were detected by NGS technology, with a sensitivity of 58.8% (20/34) and specificity of 100% (16/16). Among confirmed patients, the sensitivity of NGS was 63.6% (14/22). Of the 50 specimens that were simultaneously subjected to traditional methods, Xpert MTB/RIF test and NGS, the specificity of the three methods was 100% (16/16) based on clinical diagnosis, and the sensitivity was 29.4% (10/34), 38.2% (13/34), and 58.8% (20/34) respectively. The difference of sensitivity between the first two detection methods and NGS was statistically significant (McNemar test, p = 0.013, x2 = 5.786 and p = 0.065, x2 = 3.273). The sensitivity of traditional methods combined with NGS was as high as 82.4% (28/34).


CONCLUSIONS
NGS technology could rapidly detect the MTB complex in cerebrospinal fluid with significant sensitivity and specificity, which could be used as an early diagnosis index of TBM. NGS combined with MTB culture could increase the detection rate.},

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data, including imaging and etiological data, the use of antimicrobials, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) results, and the treatment process, of a patient who underwent IVF-ET due to an obstruction in the fallopian tube; after the treatment, she developed a persistent fever with shortness of breath and suffered a spontaneous abortion. Due to the failure of other treatment modalities, fiber optic bronchoscopy was performed, and the alveolar lavage fluid was obtained for mNGS. Tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance (Xpert MTB/RIF) showed positive and negative results, respectively. Subsequently, anti-tuberculosis treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was administered. After the patient’s condition improved, she was transferred to a specialized tuberculosis hospital for further treatment, where she died one month later from multiple organ failure. From this case, we conclude that clinicians should remain highly vigilant for pulmonary infection with M. tuberculosis in pregnant women, particularly in patients treated with IVF-ET, and check for its presence as soon as possible.},

There is an urgent need to develop the rapid, reliable and affordable diagnostic test for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) showed promising values in the rapid diagnosis of clinical TB, while studies on the application of mNGS in pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB remain scarce. Methods In this study, we collected the results of both mNGS and culture of 70 specimens from suspected TB patients at the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital of Tongji University. Results of GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) were obtained from 19 patients. We also assessed the diagnostic performance, relationship and consistency between mNGS, traditional culture method, and Xpert. Results Overall, 36 of 70 suspected patients were finally diagnosed with TB. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the Youden index of mNGS in all clinical TB specimens were calculated as 66.7% (95% CI: 0.489–0.809), 97.1% (95% CI: 0.829–0.998), 96.0% (95% CI: 0.777–0.998), 73.3% (95% CI: 0.578–0.849), 63.8%, respectively.

In pulmonary TB cases, mNGS, culture, and Xpert all demonstrated better diagnostic capacity for TB when compared with extrapulmonary TB cases. Among all methods and sample classifications, the Youden index of parallel diagnostic test in pulmonary samples was outstanding (mNGS/culture 88.2%; mNGS/Xpert 100%). Furthermore, the correlation and concordance between mNGS and culture method in all types of specimens was statistically significant (both P<0.001). Conclusions With high sensitivity and specificity, mNGS showed remarkable diagnostic performance in various samples from suspected TB patients.

abstract = {This study demonstrates that mNGS could offer an effective detection method of MTBC in BALF or lung tissue biopsy samples in patients suspected of TB infections. Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), which is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. The rapid and accurate microbiological detection of the MTBC is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of TB. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been shown to be a promising and satisfying application of detection in infectious diseases. However, relevant research about the difference in MTBC detection by mNGS between bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung biopsy tissue specimens remains scarce. Methods We used mNGS to detect pathogens in BALF and lung biopsy tissue obtained by CT-guide percutaneous lung puncture (CPLP) or radial endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial lung biopsy (R-EBUS-TBLB) from 443 hospitalized patients in mainland China suspected of pulmonary infections between May 1, 2019 and October 31, 2021. Aim to evaluate the diagnostic performance of mNGS for detecting MTBC and explore differences in the microbial composition in the 2 specimen types. Results Among the 443 patients, 46 patients finally were diagnosed with TB, of which 36 patients were detected as MTBC positive by mNGS (8.93%). Striking differences were noticed in the higher detection efficiency of lung biopsy tissue compared with BALF ( P  = 0.004). There were no significant differences between the 2 specimen types in the relative abundance among the 27 pathogens detected by mNGS from the 36 patients. Conclusions This study demonstrates that mNGS could offer an effective detection method of MTBC in BALF or lung tissue biopsy samples in patients suspected of TB infections. When it comes to the situations that BALF samples have limited value to catch pathogens for special lesion sites or the patients have contraindications to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures, lung biopsy tissue is an optional specimen for MTBC detection by mNGS. However, whether lung tissue-mNGS is superior to BALF-mNGS in patients with MTBC infection requires further prospective multicenter randomized controlled studies with more cases.},

abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is now the leading cause of death from infectious disease. Rapid screening and diagnostic methods for TB are urgently required. Rapid development of metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in recent years showed promising and satisfying application of mNGS in several kinds of infectious diseases. However, research directly evaluating the ability of mNGS in TB infection is still scarce. Methods: We conducted an adult prospective study in mainland China to evaluate the diagnostic performance of mNGS for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) in multiple forms of direct clinical samples compared with GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), traditional diagnostic methods, and the clinical final diagnosis. Results: Of 123 patients presenting with suspected active TB infection between June 1, 2017, and May 21, 2018, 105 patients underwent synchronous tuberculous testing with culture, Xpert, and mNGS on direct clinical samples including sputum, cerebrospinal fluids, pus, etc. During follow-up, 45 of 105 participants had clinical final diagnosis of active TB infection, including 13 pulmonary TB cases and 32 extrapulmonary TB cases. Compared to clinical final diagnosis, mNGS produced a sensitivity of 44% for all active TB cases, which was similar to Xpert (42%) but much higher than conventional methods (29%). With only one false-positive result, mNGS had a specificity of 98% in our study. mNGS yielded significantly much higher sensitivity in pre-treatment samples (76%) than post-treatment ones (31%) (P = 0.005), which was also true for Xpert and conventional methods. Combining Xpert and mNGS together, the study identified 27 of 45 active TB cases (60%), including all 13 conventional method-identified cases, and the result reached statistical significance compared to conventional methods (McNemar-test P < 0.001). Conclusions: mNGS had a similar diagnostic ability of MTB compared with Xpert and showed potential for a variety of clinical samples. Combined mNGS and Xpert showed an overall superior advantage over conventional methods and significantly improved the etiology diagnosis of both MTB and other pathogens. The result that anti-TB treatment significantly reduced diagnostic efficacy of culture, Xpert, and mNGS highlighted the importance of collecting samples before empirical treatment.},

Here, we retrospectively analyzed data from patients with TBM who had taken both mNGS and conventional tests including culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) stain, and the sensitivity and specificity of these methods were compared. Methods We retrospectively recruited TBM patients admitted to the hospital between December 2015 and October 2018. The first collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples underwent both mNGS and conventional tests. In addition, patients with bacterial/cryptococcal meningitis or viral meningoencephalitis were mNGS positive controls, and a patient with auto-immune encephalitis was an mNGS negative control. Results Twenty three TBM patients were classified as 12 definite and 11 clinical diagnoses, which were based on clinical manifestations, pathogen evidence, CSF parameters, brain imaging, and treatment response. The mNGS method identified sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MBTC) from 18 samples (18/23, 78.26%). In patients with definite TBM, the sensitivity of mNGS, AFB, PCR, and culture to detect MTB in the first CSF samples were 66.67, 33.33, 25, and 8.33%, respectively. The specificity of each method was 100%. Among the four negative mNGS cases (4/23, 17.39%), three turned out positive by repeated AFB stain. The agreement of mNGS with the total of conventional methods was 44.44% (8/18). Combination of mNGS and conventional methods increased the detection rate to 95.65%. One patient was diagnosed as complex of TBM and cryptococcal meningitis, in which AFB stain and cryptococcal antigen enzyme immunoassay were positive and the DNA of Cryptococcus neoformans was detected by mNGS.

Among 51 included patients, 45 cases were diagnosed as TBM (38 definite, 5 probable, 2 possible) and 6 cases with not-TBM. Using final diagnosis as reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV (positive predictive value), NPV (negative predictive value) of mNGS in CSF for TBM were 84.44% (38/45, 69.94%-93.01%), 100%(6/6, 51.68%-100%), 100% (40/40, 88.57%-100%) and 46.15% (6/13, 20.40%-73.88%). The diagnostic sensitivity of mNGS (84.4%)was significantly higher than that of AFB (0%, P = 0.000), MGIT960 culture (22.2%, P = 0.000), MTB PCR (24.4%, P = 0.000) and Xpert MTB/RIF (40%, P = 0.000). The ROC curve showed that CSF protein quantification and CSF cells count might be valuable in the prediction of NGS positive detection of MTB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis).


CONCLUSION
CSF mNGS had high sensitivity, specificity and PPV in the diagnosis of TBM. Patients with significant increase in CSF cell number and protein quantification might be higher likelihood of positive MTB detection of NGS.},

 Background: Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has gradually shown its advantages in pathogen identification for clinical infectious disease. However, few studies were conducted on the evaluation between this technique and conventional methods like culture and PCR and the prognosis of patients with infectious diseases on mechanical ventilation in ICUMethods: We conducted this retrospective study from March 2018 to May 2020 in the first Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, a total of 228 patients with suspected infectious diseases on mechanical ventilation were included, including 104 cases of mNGS group and 124 cases of non-mNGS. Statistical analyses were performed between the two groups and subgroup of whether were immunocompromised. The concordance between mNGS, culture and PCR was also assessed.Results: The 28-day mortality rate of the patients in the mNGS group was lower after the baseline difference correction (19.23% vs. 29.03%，p=0.039), indicating that mNGS may improve the prognosis of patients in ICU. And subgroup analysis showed that mNGS could improve the 28-day mortality of nonimmunosuppressive patients（14.06% vs. 29.82%, p=0.018）. According to the analysis of Logistic Regression, not performing mNGS, high APACHE II score and hypertension were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality, which strongly suggested that mNGS was one of the key factors affecting prognosis. A total of 157 samples performed mNGS, 116 of them received both mNGS and culture. mNGS presented advantages of positivity (69.8% double positive and 25.0% mNGS positive only) and concordance (79.0%, match and partly match).Conclusions: mNGS may improve the prognosis and reduce the 28-day mortality rate of patients with infectious diseases on mechanical ventilation in ICU. This technique has shown its advantages comparing with conventional methods, and will be wildly used as a promising technology for infectious disease.},

She was ultimately diagnosed with MonoMAC syndrome with Mycobacterium kansasii (M. kansasii) infection and GATA2 mutation through metagenomic generation sequencing (mNGS) of peripheral blood specimen, for which she was given anti-NTM therapy. Her situation significantly improved within 2 weeks of therapy. We discussed the clinical features, genetic characteristic, and prognosis of this disorder, aiming to further elucidate this rare syndrome. For MDS/AML patient with recurrent mixed infection and pancytopenia (especially with monocyte absence), MonoMAC syndrome should be highly suspected, and germline mutation and pathogen sequencing should be performed.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of superficial tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLN) remains difficult due to low detection rate of etiology. To increase the diagnostic value for TBLN, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) guided core biopsy was introduced to obtain the specimen followed by Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and other methods testing and to explore the optimum diagnostic pattern for TBLN in China. A prospective study was performed on patients with suspected superficial TBLN. All patients underwent CEUS-guided core biopsy from which specimens were tested by histopathology, Xpert, acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and MGIT960 culture (MGIT960), respectively. The diagnostic values were calculated and compared. A total of 328 patients were included the study, 272 were diagnosed as TBLN (254 definite TB, 18 probable TB) and 56 cases with Non-TBLN, and 100% (272/272) of TBLN patients obtained diagnosis sampled by CEUS-guided core biopsy. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of comprehensive diagnosis on the specimens by CEUS-guided core biopsy for TBLN were 100% ( 272/272, 95% CI 98.26–100.00), 94.64% (53/56, 95% CI 84.20–98.61), 98.91% (272/275, 95% CI 96.58–99.72), and 100% (53/53, 95% CI 91.58–100%), respectively. Xpert obtained 93.31% (237/254) of etiology detection rate on the specimens sampling by CEUS-guided biopsy. The etiology detection rate was associated with histopathological caseous necrosis. Current examinations on specimens by CEUS-guided core biopsy can achieve a high diagnostic efficacy for TBLN. Pathological differentiation of CEUS-guided biopsy tissue, then followed by Xpert, may be the best pattern for the diagnosis of TBLN in high TB burden areas.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical usefulness of metagenomic Next-generation sequencing (mNGS) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples to discriminate pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) from Non-TB community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in PTB suspects.


METHODS
We investigate the performance of mNGS on BALF samples from 110 PTB suspects, in comparison with conventional microbiological testing (solid media culture, acid-fast bacilli staining (AFS), Xpert) of BALF or sputum samples and final clinical diagnosis.


RESULTS
We finally clinically diagnosed 48 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 62 cases of non-tuberculosis patients. Comparing to the final clinical diagnosis, mNGS produced a sensitivity of 47.92%, which was similar to that of Xpert (45.83%) and culture (46.81%), but much higher than that of AFS (29.17%) for TB diagnosis in BALF samples. Apart from detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mNGS also identified mixed infections in PTB patients, including 3 fungal cases and 1 bacteria case. Meanwhile, mNGS efficiently identified 14 of 22 (63.63%) cases of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), 7 cases of fungi, 1 case of viral infection, and other common bacterial pathogens in Non-PTB group. Finally, mNGS identified 67.23% infection cases within 3 days, while the conventional methods identified 49.58% infection cases for over 90 days.


CONCLUSION
Our data show that mNGS of BALF represents a potentially effective tool for the rapid diagnosis of PTB suspects.},

abstract = {Background: We conducted this retrospective study to reveal the accuracy of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for diagnosing osteoarticular infections from fresh abscess specimens obtained from patients in an HIV-naive population. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed hospital records at three participating TB-specialized hospitals for patients admitted with suggestive diagnoses of osteoarticular tuberculosis between January 2018 and August 2019. Abscess specimens obtained from each patient were tested via pathogen culture, GeneXpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)/rifampicin (RIF), and mNGS assay. Results: A total of 82 abscess samples were collected from patients with osteoarticular infections, including 53 cases with (64.6%) bacterial, 21 (25.6%) with mycobacterial, 7 (8.5%) with fungal, and 1 (1.2%) with actinomycetal organisms detected. Analysis of mNGS assay results identified potential pathogens in all cases, with M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) most frequently isolated, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Brucella melitensis. Conventional culture testing identified causative pathogens in only 48.4% of samples, a significantly lower rate than the mNGS pathogen identification rate (100%, p < 0.01). Culture-positive group specimens yielded significantly greater numbers of sequence reads than did culture-negative group specimens (p < 0.01). Of patients receiving surgical interventions and mNGS-guided treatment, 76 (92.7%) experienced favorable outcomes by the time of follow-up assessment at 3 months post-treatment. Notably, MTBC detection in two patients experiencing treatment failure suggests that they had mixed infections with MTBC and other pathogens. Conclusion: Results presented here demonstrate that mNGS has a greater pathogen detection rate in osteoarticular infections than conventional culture-based methods.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the predictive value of myoglobin (Mb) for the prognosis of sepsis related chronic critical illness (CCI). Methods: Retrospective study was conducted on septic patients with the length of ICU stay equal or greater than 14 days, and sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score equal or greater than 2 on the 14th day in ICU in the First Department of Critical Care Medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2017 to March 2020. Patients' clinical and laboratory data were collected on the 1st and 14th day in ICU. The survival on day 28 in ICU was recorded. According to the myoglobin levels on day 1 and day 14, all subjects were divided into myoglobin elevation group and decline group. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare the cumulative survival rate at day 28. Cox regression analysis was used to analyze the independent risk factors of mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the prognostic value of myoglobin. Results: A total of 131 patients with sepsis related CCI were recruited, including 58 patients in the elevation group and 73 in the decline group. The Mb level in elevation group on day 1 was significantly lower than that in decline group [172.40(59.99, 430.53) μg/L vs. 413.60(184.40, 1 328.50) μg/L, Z=3.749, P=0.000], and the Mb level on day 14 was the opposite change in two groups [483.65(230.38, 1 471.75)μg/L in elevation group vs. 132.20(76.86, 274.35)μg/L in decline group, Z=5.595, P=0.000]. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that the 28-day cumulative survival rate of the elevation group was significantly lower than that of decline group (χ²=7.051, P=0.008). Cox ratio regression analysis suggested that elevated myoglobin was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in septic patients with CCI (OR=2.534, 95%CI 1.212-5.295, P=0.013). ROC curve analysis suggested that the sensitivity of myoglobin elevation in predicting mortality related to CCI within 28 days was 64.5%, and the specificity was 32.0% with area under the curve(AUC) 0.661(95%CI 0.550-0.773,P=0.007) and Jorden Index was 0.325. Conclusion: Elevated myoglobin, an independent risk factor for mortality within 28 days in ICU, can predict the prognosis of sepsis related chronic critical illness.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
To study the application value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in children with severe infectious diseases.


METHODS
An analysis was performed on the clinical data and laboratory test results of 29 children with severe infection who were admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from June 2018 to December 2020. Conventional pathogen culture was performed for the 29 specimens (27 peripheral blood specimens and 2 pleural effusion specimens) from the 29 children, and mNGS pathogen detection was performed at the same time.


RESULTS
Among the 29 children, 2 tested positive by conventional pathogen culture with 2 strains of pathogen, and the detection rate was 7% (2/29); however, 20 children tested positive by mNGS with 38 strains of pathogen, and the detection rate was 69% (20/29). The pathogen detection rate of mNGS was significantly higher than that of conventional pathogen culture (P<0.05), and mNGS could detect the viruses, fungi, and other special pathogens that conventional pathogen culture failed to detect, such as Orientia tsutsugamushi. The univariate analysis showed that gender, routine blood test results, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, radiological findings, and whether antibiotics were used before admission did not affect the results of mNGS (P>0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Compared with conventional pathogen culture, mNGS is more sensitive for pathogen detection, with fewer interference factors. Therefore, it is a better pathogenic diagnosis method for severe infectious diseases in children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Tuberculosis (TB) is a rare etiology of the septic shock. Timely administration of the anti-microbial agents has shown mortality benefit. Prompt diagnosis and a high index of suspicion are crucial to the management. We present three cases of TBSS with poor outcome in the majority despite timely and susceptible antibiotic administration. CASE SUMMARY Sixty-seven-year-old woman with latent TB presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. She was promptly diagnosed with active TB and started on the appropriate anti-microbial regimen; she had a worsening clinical course with septic shock and multi-organ failure after initiation of antibiotics. Thirty-three-year-old man immunocompromised with acquired immune deficiency syndrome presented with fever, anorexia and weight loss. He had no respiratory symptoms, and first chest X-ray was normal. He had enlarged liver, spleen and lymph nodes suspicious for lymphoma. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, he succumbed to refractory septic shock and multi-organ failure. It was shortly before his death that anti-TB antimicrobials were initiated based on pathology reports of bone marrow and lymph node biopsies. Forty-nine-year-old woman with asthma and latent TB admitted with cough and shortness of breath. Although Initial sputum analysis was negative, a subsequent broncho-alveolar lavage turned out to be positive for acid fast bacilli followed by initiation of susceptible ant-TB regimen. She had a downward spiral clinical course with shock, multi-organ failure and finally death. CONCLUSION Worse outcome despite timely initiation of appropriate antibiotics raises suspicion of TB immune reconstitution as a possible pathogenesis for TB septic shock.},

abstract = {Background: Infection of Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) could lead to serious clinical manifestations in humans, including severe pneumonia with rapid progression, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS), and probably death. Implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the patient with severe ARDS gives a promising new method for recovery. Case Presentation: We report our successful use of venovenous (VV) ECMO in a 48-year-old man who manifested with severe respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and septic shock caused by a diagnosis of pneumonia. After the combination of therapy including anti-infection, mechanical ventilation, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), acute inflammatory syndrome developed. However, his respiratory status rapidly deteriorated. Then, venoarterial (VA)-ECMO support was placed on the patient as suddenly slowing of the heart rate. Harlequin (North-South) syndrome occurred after ECMO initiation. A series of the process could not relieve hypoxia in the upper body. At last, transition to VV-ECMO improved hypoxia. The duration of VV-ECMO was 7 days and the mechanical ventilation was weaned on the next day. On the day of ECMO weaning, nanopore targeted sequencing (NTS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) reported the presence of C. psittaci. After 19 days of critical systemic rehabilitation and combination therapy, the patient fully recovered from C. psittaci. Conclusion: This is the first reported case of the patient receiving ECMO for C. psittaci pneumonia. ECMO puts the lungs on temporary rest, promotes the recovery of pulmonary function, and also wins time for finding the pathogens, which is crucial in the treatment of rare pathogens.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
Diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy is important in Japan because it currently has a moderate tuberculosis prevalence. However, physicians often have difficulty making a diagnosis. It was reported that thoracoscopy under local anesthesia is useful for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy, but there are no reports focusing on elderly patients.


METHODS
In this study, the usefulness of thoracoscopy under local anesthesia was evaluated in elderly patients. Among 170 patients who underwent thoracoscopy under local anesthesia at our hospital during 11 years from January 2008 to December 2018, those aged 75 years or older (n = 75) were investigated retrospectively.


RESULTS
A total of 55 patients underwent thoracoscopy under local anesthesia for detailed examination of pleural effusion of unknown cause. Of these, 18 were diagnosed as tuberculous pleurisy. The median age was 82 years (range: 75-92 years). The diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy was made in 11 patients in whom Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected and in four patients whose pathological findings indicated epithelioid granuloma accompanied by caseous necrosis. Clinical diagnosis was made in the remaining three patients based on thoracoscopic findings of the pleural cavity and a high level of adenosine deaminase in pleural fluid. No serious complications attributable to the examination were observed in any patient.


CONCLUSIONS
Thoracoscopy under local anesthesia was useful for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy in elderly patients, with useful information being also obtained for the treatment of tuberculosis.},
