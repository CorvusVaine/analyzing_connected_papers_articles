abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most deadly cancer worldwide. The use of gut microbiome in early detection of the disease has attracted much attention from the research community, mainly because of its noninvasive nature. Recent achievements in next generation sequencing technology have led to increased availability of sequence data and enabled an environment for the growth of gut microbiome research. The use of conventional machine learning algorithms for automatic detection of CRC based on the microbiome is limited by factors such as low accuracy and the need for manual selection of features. Despite their success in other fields, Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms have limitations in microbiome-based CRC classification. These limitations include high dimensionality of microbiome data and other characteristics associated with sequence data such as feature dominance. In this paper, we propose a feature augmentation approach that aggregates data normalization methods to extend existing features of a dataset. The proposed method combines feature extension with data augmentation to improve CRC classification performance of a DNN model. The proposed model obtained area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.96 and 0.89 on two publicly available microbiome datasets.},

We convert such datasets to imagesets while attempting to give each image structure that is amenable for use with convolutional neural networks. Experimental results on two publicly available, sparse datasets show that the approach can boost classification performance compared to other methods, which may be attributed to the formation of visually distinguishable shapes on the resultant images.},

The classification of the intricate data patterns collected through these sensors is a challenging task when considering hand-crafted features and pattern recognition algorithms. In this work, to face this challenge, we propose a convolutional neural network architecture along with two methods for transforming sensor data stream into images, and two recurrent neural networks, a long short time memory network and a gated recurrent unit network. The proposed model was evaluated using the UniMiB SHAR dataset. This dataset was acquired with accelerometers of mobile devices. The best macro average accuracy for classification of 17 types of activities, with 5-fold-cross-validation method, 95.49% was obtained with a gated recurrent unit network. The best macro average accuracy for classification with leave-one-subject-out method, 71.36%, was obtained with a convolutional neural network. These results are better than others previously published in the literature with the same dataset.},

abstract = {Microbes colonizing colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors have the potential to affect disease, and vice-versa. The manner in which they differ from microbes in physically adjacent tissue or stool within the case in terms of both, taxonomy and biological activity remains unclear. In this study, we systematically analyzed previously published 16S rRNA sequence data from CRC patients with matched tumor:tumor-adjacent biopsies (n = 294 pairs, n = 588 biospecimens) and matched tumor biopsy:fecal pairs (n = 42 pairs, n = 84 biospecimens). Procrustes analyses, random effects regression, random forest (RF) modeling, and inferred functional pathway analyses were conducted to assess community similarity and microbial diversity across heterogeneous patient groups and studies. Our results corroborate previously reported association of increased Fusobacterium with tumor biopsies. Parvimonas and Streptococcus abundances were also elevated while Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcaceae abundances decreased in tumors relative to tumor-adjacent biopsies and stool samples from the same case. With the exception of these limited taxa, the majority of findings from individual studies were not confirmed by other 16S rRNA gene-based datasets. RF models comparing tumor and tumor-adjacent specimens yielded an area under curve (AUC) of 64.3%, and models of tumor biopsies versus fecal specimens exhibited an AUC of 82.5%. Although some taxa were shared between fecal and tumor samples, their relative abundances varied substantially. Inferred functional analysis identified potential differences in branched amino acid and lipid metabolism. Microbial markers that reliably occur in tumor tissue can have implications for microbiome based and microbiome targeting therapeutics for CRC.},

abstract = {Simple Summary Growing evidence shows a close relationship between the microbiome and colorectal cancer, but most studies analyze fecal samples. However, solid information on the microbial community that is present locally in the intestinal tumor tissues is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to compile evidence on the relationship between tissue-associated microbiota and colorectal cancer. Among 5080 screened publications, 39 were eligible and included in the analysis. Despite the heterogeneity in methodologies and reporting between studies, 12 groups of bacteria with strong positive and 18 groups of bacteria with strong negative associations with colorectal cancer were identified. Such knowledge may ultimately be used in novel strategies that aim to prevent, detect, and treat colorectal cancer in the upcoming years. Abstract The intestinal microbiome is associated with colorectal cancer. Although the mucosal microbiota better represents an individual’s local microbiome, studies on the colorectal cancer microbiota mainly reflect knowledge obtained from fecal samples. This systematic review aimed to summarize the current evidence on the relationship between the mucosal-associated bacterial microbiota and colorectal cancer. Searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science databases for publications comparing the mucosal microbiome of colorectal cancer patients with that of healthy controls, or with that of non-cancerous mucosal tissues. The primary outcomes were differences in microbial diversity and taxonomy. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Of the 5080 studies identified, 39 were eligible and included in the systematic review. No consistent results were identified for the α- and β-diversity, due to high heterogeneity in reporting and to differences in metrics and statistical approaches, limiting study comparability. Qualitative synthesis of microbial taxonomy identified 12 taxa with strong positive and 18 taxa with strong negative associations with colorectal cancer. Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, and Granulicatella were defined as enriched in colorectal cancer. Despite the methodological limitations of the studies, consistent evidence on bacterial taxa associated with colorectal cancer was identified. Prospective studies in large and well-characterized patient populations will be crucial to validate these findings.},

ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) modeling of the human microbiome has the potential to identify microbial biomarkers and aid in the diagnosis of many diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Progress has been made toward developing ML models that predict health outcomes using bacterial abundances, but inconsistent adoption of training and evaluation methods call the validity of these models into question. Furthermore, there appears to be a preference by many researchers to favor increased model complexity over interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we trained seven models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to predict the presence of colonic screen relevant neoplasias (SRNs) (n = 490 patients, 261 controls and 229 cases). We developed a reusable open-source pipeline to train, validate, and interpret ML models. To show the effect of model selection, we assessed the predictive performance, interpretability, and training time of L2-regularized logistic regression, L1- and L2-regularized support vector machines (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). The random forest model performed best at detecting SRNs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.695 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.651 to 0.739) but was slow to train (83.2 h) and not inherently interpretable. Despite its simplicity, L2-regularized logistic regression followed random forest in predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.680 (IQR, 0.625 to 0.735), trained faster (12 min), and was inherently interpretable. Our analysis highlights the importance of choosing an ML approach based on the goal of the study, as the choice will inform expectations of performance and interpretability.

These four bacteria markers distinguished CRC from controls (AUROC = 0.925) in our validation cohort. We identified bacteria species significantly associated (cut-off value of > 5 fold abundance) with various CRC demographics such as ethnicity, gender and CRC staging; however, due to small sample size of the discovery cohort, these results could not be further verified in our validation cohort. In summary, Parvimonas micra, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Akkermansia muciniphila were enriched in our local CRC patients.

abstract = {Purpose: There is potential for fecal microbiome profiling to improve colorectal cancer screening. This has been demonstrated by research studies, but it has not been quantified at scale using samples collected and processed routinely by a national screening program. Experimental Design: Between 2016 and 2019, the largest of the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme hubs prospectively collected processed guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) samples with subsequent colonoscopy outcomes: blood-negative [n = 491 (22%)]; colorectal cancer [n = 430 (19%)]; adenoma [n = 665 (30%)]; colonoscopy-normal [n = 300 (13%)]; nonneoplastic [n = 366 (16%)]. Samples were transported and stored at room temperature. DNA underwent 16S rRNA gene V4 amplicon sequencing. Taxonomic profiling was performed to provide features for classification via random forests (RF). Results: Samples provided 16S amplicon-based microbial profiles, which confirmed previously described colorectal cancer–microbiome associations. Microbiome-based RF models showed potential as a first-tier screen, distinguishing colorectal cancer or neoplasm (colorectal cancer or adenoma) from blood-negative with AUC 0.86 (0.82–0.89) and AUC 0.78 (0.74–0.82), respectively. Microbiome-based models also showed potential as a second-tier screen, distinguishing from among gFOBT blood-positive samples, colorectal cancer or neoplasm from colonoscopy-normal with AUC 0.79 (0.74–0.83) and AUC 0.73 (0.68–0.77), respectively. Models remained robust when restricted to 15 taxa, and performed similarly during external validation with metagenomic datasets. Conclusions: Microbiome features can be assessed using gFOBT samples collected and processed routinely by a national colorectal cancer screening program to improve accuracy as a first- or second-tier screen. The models required as few as 15 taxa, raising the potential of an inexpensive qPCR test. This could reduce the number of colonoscopies in countries that use fecal occult blood test screening.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT An increasing body of literature suggests that both individual and collections of bacteria are associated with the progression of colorectal cancer. As the number of studies investigating these associations increases and the number of subjects in each study increases, a meta-analysis to identify the associations that are the most predictive of disease progression is warranted. We analyzed previously published 16S rRNA gene sequencing data collected from feces and colon tissue. We quantified the odds ratios (ORs) for individual bacterial taxa that were associated with an individual having tumors relative to a normal colon. Among the fecal samples, there were no taxa that had significant ORs associated with adenoma and there were 8 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Similarly, among the tissue samples, there were no taxa that had a significant OR associated with adenoma and there were 3 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Among the significant ORs, the association between individual taxa and tumor diagnosis was equal to or below 7.11. Because individual taxa had limited association with tumor diagnosis, we trained Random Forest classification models using only the taxa that had significant ORs, using the entire collection of taxa found in each study, and using operational taxonomic units defined based on a 97% similarity threshold. All training approaches yielded similar classification success as measured using the area under the curve. The ability to correctly classify individuals with adenomas was poor, and the ability to classify individuals with carcinomas was considerably better using sequences from feces or tissue. IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is a significant and growing health problem in which animal models and epidemiological data suggest that the colonic microbiota have a role in tumorigenesis. These observations indicate that the colonic microbiota is a reservoir of biomarkers that may improve our ability to detect colonic tumors using noninvasive approaches. This meta-analysis identifies and validates a set of 8 bacterial taxa that can be used within a Random Forest modeling framework to differentiate individuals as having normal colons or carcinomas. When models trained using one data set were tested on other data sets, the models performed well. These results lend support to the use of fecal biomarkers for the detection of tumors. Furthermore, these biomarkers are plausible candidates for further mechanistic studies into the role of the gut microbiota in tumorigenesis.

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cancer worldwide, with a growing incidence among young adults. Multiple studies have presented associations between the gut microbiome and CRC, suggesting a link with cancer risk. Although CRC microbiome studies continue to profile larger patient cohorts with increasingly economical and rapid DNA sequencing platforms, few common associations with CRC have been identified, in part due to limitations in taxonomic resolution and differences in analysis methodologies. Complementing these taxonomic studies is the newly recognized phenomenon that bacterial organization into biofilm structures in the mucus layer of the gut is a consistent feature of right-sided (proximal), but not left-sided (distal) colorectal cancer. In the present study, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and biofilm quantification in a new cohort of patients from Malaysia, followed by a meta-analysis of eleven additional publicly available data sets on stool and tissue-based CRC microbiota using Resphera Insight, a high-resolution analytical tool for species-level characterization. Results from the Malaysian cohort and the expanded meta-analysis confirm that CRC tissues are enriched for invasive biofilms (particularly on right-sided tumors), a symbiont with capacity for tumorigenesis (Bacteroides fragilis), and oral pathogens including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Peptostreptococcus stomatis. Considered in aggregate, species from the Human Oral Microbiome Database are highly enriched in CRC. Although no detected microbial feature was universally present, their substantial overlap and combined prevalence supports a role for the gut microbiota in a significant percentage (>80%) of CRC cases.Bowel cancer: Spotlight of suspicion on bacteriaMany studies have found a link between gut microbes and bowel cancer, the third most common cancer worldwide. The details of the association, however, have remained elusive. Researchers in the USA and Malaysia, led by Dr. Cynthia Sears at John Hopkins School of Medicine in Maryland, examined mucosal biofilm status by fluorescence microscopy and performed a meta-analysis of bacterial genetic associations in stool and colon tissues to clarify the connection. They found that bowel cancers were enriched in invasive bacterial biofilms as well as several specific gut and oral species, including one - Fusobacterium nucleatum - known to promote tumorigenesis in mouse models. Analyzing gut microbial populations might help assess bowel cancer risk. Further research is needed, however, to determine if these  bacteria directly contribute to disease causality.},

However, the microbiomes of surrounding adjacent tissues of colonic cancerous tissues were seldom investigated uniformly on a large scale. Here, we characterize the microbiome signatures and dysbiosis of various colonic cancer sample groups. We found a high correlation between colorectal carcinoma adjacent tissue microbiomes and their on-site counterparts.

ABSTRACT As research focusing on the colorectal cancer fecal microbiome using shotgun sequencing continues, increasing evidence has supported correlations between colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and fecal microbiome dysbiosis. However, large-scale on-site and off-site (surrounding adjacent) tissue microbiome characterization of CRC was underrepresented. Here, considering each taxon as a feature, we demonstrate a machine learning-based method to investigate tissue microbial differences among CRC, colorectal adenoma (CRA), and healthy control groups using 16S rRNA data sets retrieved from 15 studies. A total of 2,099 samples were included and analyzed in case-control comparisons. Multiple methods, including differential abundance analysis, random forest classification, cooccurrence network analysis, and Dirichlet multinomial mixture analysis, were conducted to investigate the microbial signatures. We showed that the dysbiosis of the off-site tissue of colonic cancer was distinctive and predictive. The AUCs (areas under the curve) were 80.7%, 96.0%, and 95.8% for CRC versus healthy control random forest models using stool, tissue, and adjacent tissue samples and 69.9%, 91.5%, and 89.5% for the corresponding CRA models, respectively. We also found that the microbiota ecologies of the surrounding adjacent tissues of CRC and CRA were similar to their on-site counterparts according to network analysis. Furthermore, based on the enterotyping of tissue samples, the cohort-specific microbial signature might be the crux in addressing classification generalization problems. Despite cohort heterogeneity, the dysbiosis of lesion-adjacent tissues might provide us with further perspectives in demonstrating the role of the microbiota in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis. IMPORTANCE Turbulent fecal and tissue microbiome dysbiosis of colorectal carcinoma and adenoma has been identified, and some taxa have been proven to be carcinogenic. However, the microbiomes of surrounding adjacent tissues of colonic cancerous tissues were seldom investigated uniformly on a large scale. Here, we characterize the microbiome signatures and dysbiosis of various colonic cancer sample groups. We found a high correlation between colorectal carcinoma adjacent tissue microbiomes and their on-site counterparts. We also discovered that the microbiome dysbiosis in adjacent tissues could discriminate colorectal carcinomas from healthy controls effectively. These results extend our knowledge on the microbial profile of colorectal cancer tissues and highlight microbiota dysbiosis in the surrounding tissues.

On the other hand, colorectal cancer is the second most deadly and the third most common type of cancer in the world according to GLOBOCAN 2020 data. The mechanisms behind IBD and IBS are still speculative. The conventional methods to identify colorectal cancer, IBD, and IBS are based on endoscopy or colonoscopy to identify lesions. However, it is invasive, demanding, and time‐consuming for early‐stage intestinal diseases. To address those problems, new strategies based on blood and/or human microbiome in gut, colon, or even feces were developed; those methods took advantage of high‐throughput sequencing and machine learning approaches. In this review, we summarize the recent research and methods to diagnose intestinal diseases with machine learning technologies based on cell‐free DNA and microbiome data generated by amplicon sequencing or whole‐genome sequencing. Those methods play an important role in not only intestinal disease diagnosis but also therapy development in the near future.},

 Background Gut microbiome is gaining interest because its links with several diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Results Here we performed a meta-analysis of 851 fecal metagenomic samples from five publicly available studies. We used an interpretable machine learning approach based on functional profiles, instead of the conventional taxonomic profiles, to produce a highly accurate predictor of CRC with better precision than those of previous proposals. Moreover, this approach is also able to discriminate samples with adenoma, which makes this approach very promising for CRC prevention by detecting early stages in which intervention is easier and more effective. In addition, interpretable machine learning methods allows extracting features relevant for the classification, which reveals basic molecular mechanisms accounting for the changes underwent by the microbiome functional landscape in the transition from healthy gut to adenoma and CRC conditions. Conclusion Functional profiles provide superior accuracy in predicting CCR and adenoma conditions than taxonomic profiles and additionally, in a context of explainable machine learning, provide useful hints on the molecular mechanisms operating in the microbiota behind these conditions.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks second in cancer-associated mortality and third in the incidence worldwide. Most of CRC follow adenoma-carcinoma sequence, and have more than 90% chance of survival if diagnosed at early stage. But the recommended screening by colonoscopy is invasive, expensive, and poorly adhered to. Recently, several studies reported that the fecal bacteria might provide non-invasive biomarkers for CRC and precancerous tumors. Therefore, we collected and uniformly re-analyzed these published fecal 16S rDNA sequencing datasets to verify the association and identify biomarkers to classify and predict colorectal tumors by random forest method. A total of 1674 samples (330 CRC, 357 advanced adenoma, 141 adenoma, and 846 control) from 7 studies were analyzed in this study. By random effects model and fixed effects model, we observed significant differences in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity between individuals with CRC and the normal colon, but not between adenoma and the normal. We identified various bacterial genera with significant odds ratios for colorectal tumors at different stages. Through building random forest model with 10-fold cross-validation as well as new test datasets, we classified individuals with CRC, advanced adenoma, adenoma and normal colon. All approaches obtained comparable performance at entire OTU level, entire genus level, and the common genus level as measured using AUC. When combined all samples, the AUC of random forest model based on 12 common genera reached 0.846 for CRC, although the predication performed poorly for advance adenoma and adenoma.},

Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.Multicohort analysis identifies microbial signatures of colorectal cancer in fecal microbiomes.},

In spite of this mathematical simplicity, our understanding of the normalizing constant remains far from complete.

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Advances in next-generation sequencing have made it possible to carry out transcriptomic studies at single-cell resolution and generate vast amounts of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data rapidly. Thus, tools to analyze this data need to evolve as well as to improve accuracy and efficiency.


RESULTS
We present FEATS, a Python software package, that performs clustering on single-cell RNA-seq data. FEATS is capable of performing multiple tasks such as estimating the number of clusters, conducting outlier detection and integrating data from various experiments. We develop a univariate feature selection-based approach for clustering, which involves the selection of top informative features to improve clustering performance. This is motivated by the fact that cell types are often manually determined using the expression of only a few known marker genes. On a variety of single-cell RNA-seq datasets, FEATS gives superior performance compared with the current tools, in terms of adjusted Rand index and estimating the number of clusters. It achieves a 22% improvement in clustering and more accurately estimates the number of clusters when compared with other tools. In addition to cluster estimation, FEATS also performs outlier detection and data integration while giving an excellent computational performance. Thus, FEATS is a comprehensive clustering tool capable of addressing the challenges during the clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data.

abstract = {The importance of the tumour microbiome in different aspects of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been increasingly recognised, but many questions remain. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of specific CRC associated microbes on the tumour immune response, which has a considerable prognostic value in CRC. We applied specific qPCR to detect Parvimonas micra and Fusobacterium nucleatum in tumour tissues from an immunologically well-characterised cohort of 69 CRC patients. This cohort included detailed analyses of immune profiles based on flow cytometry and transcriptomics in tumour tissue and blood, along with comprehensive analyses of molecular subtypes. P. micra and F. nucleatum were detected in 24% and 64% of tumour tissues, respectively. We found a significant association of P. micra with high-grade tumours and tumours of CMS1 subtype. F. nucleatum was significantly associated with right-sided tumours, microsatellite instability, and CMS1 tumours. The immunological analyses revealed significant associations of P. micra with activated CD69+ T lymphocytes and increased antigen-presenting HLA-DR+ B lymphocytes. P. micra was also positively associated with M1 and M2 macrophage traits. The impact of P. micra tumour colonisation on the immune response was further assessed using transcriptomics in validation of our findings. No associations were found between F. nucleatum and immune profiles in this study. Our findings support novel associations between P. micra and the immune response in CRC. A better understanding of these interactions might help to identify important predictive and prognostic tools as well as new targets for therapy.},

We propose a simple and highly replicable way of plotting the time series, and feed these images as input to a non-optimized shallow CNN, without any normalization or residual connections. These representations are no more than default line plots using the time series data, where the only pre-processing applied is to reduce the number of white pixels in the image. We compare our method with different state-of-the-art methods specialized in time series classification on two real-world non public datasets, as well as 98 datasets of the UCR dataset collection. The results show that our approach is very promising, achieving the best results on both real-world datasets and matching / beating the best state-of-the-art methods in six UCR datasets. We argue that, if a simple naive design like ours can obtain such good results, it is worth further exploring the capabilities of using image representation of time series data, along with more powerful CNNs, for classification and other related tasks.},

abstract = {Time series forecasting is essential for decision making in many domains. In this work, we address the challenge of predicting prices evolution among multiple potentially interacting financial assets. A solution to this problem has obvious importance for governments, banks, and investors. Statistical methods such as Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are widely applied to these problems. In this paper, we propose to approach economic time series forecasting of multiple financial assets in a novel way via video prediction. Given past prices of multiple potentially interacting financial assets, we aim to predict the prices evolution in the future. Instead of treating the snapshot of prices at each time point as a vector, we spatially layout these prices in 2D as an image similar to market change visualization, and we can harness the power of CNNs in learning a latent representation for these financial assets. Thus, the history of these prices becomes a sequence of images, and our goal becomes predicting future images. We build on advances from computer vision for video prediction. Our experiments involve the prediction task of the price evolution of nine financial assets traded in U.S. stock markets. The proposed method outperforms baselines including ARIMA, Prophet and variations of the proposed method, demonstrating the benefits of harnessing the power of CNNs in the problem of economic time series forecasting.},

We converted serum glycopeptide expression patterns into two-dimensional (2D) barcodes to let CNN learn and distinguish between EOC and non-EOC. CNN was trained using 60% samples and validated using 40% samples. We observed that principal component analysis-based alignment of glycopeptides to generate 2D barcodes significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy (88%) of the method. When CNN was trained with 2D barcodes colored on the basis of serum levels of CA125 and HE4, a diagnostic accuracy of 95% was achieved.

abstract = {The human microbiome defined as the microbial communities that live in and on our bodies is emerging as a key factor in human diseases. The expanding research field that investigates the role of the microbiome on human cancer development, termed oncobiome, has led to important discoveries such as the role of Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Motivated by these discoveries, this thesis studied the oncobiome from different perspectives, investigating whether alterations to microbial profiles were associated with disease status or an adverse response to treatment. We used both biopsy tissue samples and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (N = 36), as well as privately and publicly available fecal whole metagenomes (N = 764) to investigate microbiome-colorectal cancer (CRC) associations. We observed significant increases in species richness in CRC, regardless of sample type or methodology, which was partially due to expansions of species typically from the oral cavity, as well as an overabundance of specific taxa such as Bacteroides fragilis , Fusobacterium , Desulfovibrio and Bilophila in CRC. Functional potential analysis of CRC metagenomes revealed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase ( cutC ) gene was over-abundant in CRC, with the strength of association dependent on four identified sequence variants, pointing at a novel potential mechanism of CRC carcinogenesis. Predictive microbiome signatures trained on the combination of multiple datasets showed very high and consistent performances on distinct cohorts (average AUC 0.83, minimum 0.81). To investigate the microbiome’s role in response to treatment, we profiled microbial communities of gastric wash samples in gastric cancer patients (N = 36) before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Gastric wash microbial communities presented remarkably high inter-individual variation, with significant decreases in richness and phylogenetic diversity after treatment and associations with pH, pathological response and sample collection. The most abundant genera found in patients before or after chemotherapy treatment included Streptococcus , Prevotella , Rothia and Veillonella . Despite limitations inherent to differing experimental choices, this thesis provides microbiome signatures that can be the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies, as well as supporting the role of the human oral microbiome in whole-body diseases.},

To investigate the alterations of P. micra abundance in the gut along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted to measure the relative abundance of P. micra in fecal samples from 277 subjects (128 patients with CRA, 66 patients with CRC and 83 healthy individuals, as controls) who underwent colonoscopy as outpatients. Then, the relative abundance of P. micra was analyzed in fecal samples from 596 subjects (185 healthy controls, 158 CRC, 253 CRA) in four public 16S rRNA sequencing datasets. The qPCR results demonstrated that the CRA group had an abundance of P. micra (P=0.2) similar to that of the healthy control group, while the CRC group had a significantly increased abundance (P=8.2×10−11). The level of P. micra effectively discriminated patients with CRC from healthy controls, while it poorly discriminated patients with CRA from healthy controls; with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 for patients with CRC and 0.554 for patients with CRA. The same pattern of the alteration of P. micra abundance, which was low in healthy controls and patients with CRA but elevated in patients with CRC, was found in all four public sequencing datasets. These results suggested that P. micra was closely associated with, and may serve as a diagnostic marker for, CRC but not CRA. Moreover, it was indicated that P. micra may be an opportunistic pathogen of CRC, which may promote CRC development but serve a limited role in tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {A lot of previous studies have recently reported that the gut microbiota influences the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Western countries, but the role of the gut microbiota in Chinese population must be investigated fully. The goal of this study was to determine the role of the gut microbiome in the initiation and development of CRC. We collected fecal samples of 206 Chinese individuals: 59 with polyp (group P), 54 with adenoma (group A), 51 with colorectal cancer (group CC), and 42 healthy controls (group HC).16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used to compare the microbiota community structures among healthy controls, patients with polyp, and those with adenoma or colorectal cancer. Our study proved that intestinal flora, as a specific indicator, showed significant differences in its diversity and composition. Sobs, Chao, and Ace indexes of group CC were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group (CC group: Sobs, Chao, and Ace indexes were 217.3 ± 69, 4265.1 ± 80.7, and 268.6 ± 78.1, respectively; HC group: Sobs, Chao, and Ace indexes were 228.8 ± 44.4, 272.9 ± 58.6, and 271.9 ± 57.2, respectively). When compared with the healthy individuals, the species richness and diversity of intestinal flora in patients with colorectal cancer were significantly reduced: PCA and PCoA both revealed that a significant separation in bacterial community composition between the CC group and HC group (with PCA using the first two principal component scores of PC1 14.73% and PC2 10.34% of the explained variance, respectively; PCoA : PC1 = 14%, PC2 = 9%, PC3 = 6%). Wilcox tests was used to analyze differences between the two groups, it reveals that Firmicutes (P=0.000356), Fusobacteria (P=0.000001), Proteobacteria (P=0.000796), Spirochaetes (P=0.013421), Synergistetes (P=0.005642) were phyla with significantly different distributions between cases and controls. The proportion of microorganism composition is varying at different stages of colon cancer development: Bacteroidetes (52.14%) and Firmicutes (35.88%) were enriched in the healthy individuals; on the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes (52.14%-53.92%-52.46%–47.06%) and Firmicutes (35.88%-29.73%-24.27%–25.36%) is decreasing with the development of health-polyp-adenomas-CRC, and the abundance of Proteobacteria (9.33%-12.31%-16.51%–22.37%) is increasing. PCA and PCOA analysis showed there was no significant (P < 0.05) difference in species similarity between precancerous and carcinogenic states. However, the composition of the microflora in patients with precancerous lesions (including patients with adenoma and polyp) was proved to have no significant disparity (P < 0.05). Our study provides insights into new angles to dig out potential biomarkers in diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer and to provide scientific advice for a healthy lifestyle for the sake of gut microbiota.},

abstract = {Due to the huge number of bacteria constituting the human colon microbiota, alteration in the balance of its constitutive taxa (i.e., dysbiosis) is highly suspected of being involved in colorectal oncogenesis. Indeed, bacterial signatures in association with CRC have been described. These signatures may vary if bacteria are identified in feces or in association with tumor tissues. Here, we show that bacteria colonize human colonic crypts in tissues obtained from patients with CRC and with normal colonoscopy results. Aerobic nonfermentative Proteobacteria previously identified as constitutive of the crypt-specific core microbiota in murine colonic samples are similarly prevalent in human colonic crypts in combination with other anaerobic taxa. We also show that bacterial signatures characterizing the crypts of colonic tumors vary depending whether right-side or left-side tumors are analyzed. ABSTRACT We have previously identified a crypt-specific core microbiota (CSCM) in the colons of healthy laboratory mice and related wild rodents. Here, we confirm that a CSCM also exists in the human colon and appears to be altered during colon cancer. The colonic microbiota is suggested to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Because the microbiota identified in fecal samples from CRC patients does not directly reflect the microbiota associated with tumor tissues themselves, we sought to characterize the bacterial communities from the crypts and associated adjacent mucosal surfaces of 58 patients (tumor and normal homologous tissue) and 9 controls with normal colonoscopy results. Here, we confirm that bacteria colonize human colonic crypts in both control and CRC tissues, and using laser-microdissected tissues and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we further show that right and left crypt- and mucosa-associated bacterial communities are significantly different. In addition to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and as with murine proximal colon crypts, environmental nonfermentative Proteobacteria are found in human colonic crypts. Fusobacterium and Bacteroides fragilis are more abundant in right-side tumors, whereas Parvimonas micra is more prevalent in left-side tumors. More precisely, Fusobacterium periodonticum is more abundant in crypts from cancerous samples in the right colon than in associated nontumoral samples from adjacent areas but not in left-side colonic samples. Future analysis of the interaction between these bacteria and the crypt epithelium, particularly intestinal stem cells, will allow deciphering of their possible oncogenic potential. IMPORTANCE Due to the huge number of bacteria constituting the human colon microbiota, alteration in the balance of its constitutive taxa (i.e., dysbiosis) is highly suspected of being involved in colorectal oncogenesis.

abstract = {Several studies have investigated the association between microbial and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the replicable markers for early stage adenoma diagnosis across multiple populations remain elusive. Here, a meta-analysis of six studies, comprising a total of 1057 fecal samples, was performed to identify candidate markers. By adjusting the potential confounders, 11 and 26 markers (P<0.05) were identified and separately applied into constructing Random Forest classifier models to discriminate adenoma from control, and adenoma from CRC, achieving robust diagnostic accuracy with AUC = 0.80 and 0.89, respectively. Moreover, these markers demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in independent validation cohorts. Pooled functional analysis and targeted qRT-PCR based genetic profiles reveal that the altered microbiome triggers different pathways of ADP-heptose and menaquinone biosynthesis (P<0.05) in adenoma vs. control and adenoma vs. CRC sequences respectively. The combined analysis of heterogeneous studies confirm adenoma-specific but universal markers across multi-populations, which improves early diagnosis and prompt treatment of CRC.},

abstract = {Background The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in developing countries, yet limited research on the CRC- associated microbiota has been conducted in these areas, in part due to scarce resources, facilities, and the difficulty of fresh or frozen stool storage/transport. Here, we aimed (1) to establish a broad representation of diverse developing countries (Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam); (2) to validate a ‘resource-light’ sample-collection protocol translatable in these settings using guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) cards stored and, importantly, shipped internationally at room temperature; (3) to perform initial profiling of the collective CRC-associated microbiome of these developing countries; and (4) to compare this quantitatively with established CRC biomarkers from developed countries. Methods We assessed the effect of international storage and transport at room temperature by replicating gFOBT from five UK volunteers, storing two in the UK, and sending replicates to institutes in the four countries. Next, to determine the effect of prolonged UK storage, DNA extraction replicates for a subset of samples were performed up to 252 days apart. To profile the CRC-associated microbiome of developing countries, gFOBT were collected from 41 treatment-naïve CRC patients and 40 non-CRC controls from across the four institutes, and V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed. Finally, we constructed a random forest (RF) model that was trained and tested against existing datasets from developed countries. Results The microbiome was stably assayed when samples were stored/transported at room temperature and after prolonged UK storage. Large-scale microbiome structure was separated by country and continent, with a smaller effect from CRC. Importantly, the RF model performed similarly to models trained using external datasets and identified similar taxa of importance ( Parvimonas , Peptostreptococcus , Fusobacterium , Alistipes , and Escherichia ). Conclusions This study demonstrates that gFOBT, stored and transported at room temperature, represents a suitable method of faecal sample collection for amplicon-based microbiome biomarkers in developing countries and suggests a CRC-faecal microbiome association that is consistent between developed and developing countries.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common clinical malignancy globally ranked as the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality. Some microbes are known to contribute to adenoma-carcinoma transition and possess diagnostic potential. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technology and functional studies have provided significant insights into the landscape of the gut microbiome and the fundamental roles of its components in carcinogenesis. Integration of scattered knowledge is highly beneficial for future progress. In this study, literature review and information extraction were performed, with the aim of integrating the available data resources and facilitating comparative research. A knowledgebase of the human CRC microbiome was compiled to facilitate understanding of diagnosis, and the global signatures of CRC microbes, sample types, algorithms, differential microorganisms and various panels of markers plus their diagnostic performance were evaluated based on statistical and phylogenetic analyses. Additionally, prospects about current changelings and solution strategies were outlined for identifying future research directions. This type of data integration strategy presents an effective platform for inquiry and comparison of relevant information, providing a tool for further study about CRC-related microbes and exploration of factors promoting clinical transformation (available at: http://gsbios.com/index/experimental/dts_ mben?id=1).},

abstract = {Sporadic and inflammatory forms of colorectal cancer (CRC) account for more than 80% of cases. Recent publications have shown mechanistic evidence for the involvement of gut bacteria in the development of both CRC-forms. Whereas, colon and rectal cancer have been routinely studied together as CRC, increasing evidence show these to be distinct diseases. Also, the common use of fecal samples to study microbial communities may reflect disease state but possibly not the tumor microenvironment. We performed this study to evaluate differences in bacterial communities found in tissue samples of 18 rectal-cancer subjects when compared to 18 non-cancer controls. Samples were collected during exploratory colonoscopy (non-cancer group) or during surgery for tumor excision (rectal-cancer group). High throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4–V5 region was conducted on the Ion PGM platform, reads were filtered using Qiime and clustered using UPARSE. We observed significant increases in species richness and diversity in rectal cancer samples, evidenced by the total number of OTUs and the Shannon and Simpson indexes. Enterotyping analysis divided our cohort into two groups, with the majority of rectal cancer samples clustering into one enterotype, characterized by a greater abundance of Bacteroides and Dorea. At the phylum level, rectal-cancer samples had increased abundance of candidate phylum OD1 (also known as Parcubacteria) whilst non-cancer samples had increased abundance of Planctomycetes. At the genera level, rectal-cancer samples had higher abundances of Bacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Parabacteroides, Desulfovibrio, and Odoribacter whereas non-cancer samples had higher abundances of Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, and Bacillus. Two Bacteroides fragilis OTUs were more abundant among rectal-cancer patients seen through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, whose presence was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and enrichment verified by digital droplet PCR. Our findings point to increased bacterial richness and diversity in rectal cancer, along with several differences in microbial community composition. Our work is the first to present evidence for a possible role of bacteria such as B. fragilis and the phylum Parcubacteria in rectal cancer, emphasizing the need to study tissue-associated bacteria and specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract in order to better understand the possible links between the microbiota and rectal cancer.},

abstract = {Objective To characterise the gut microbiome in subjects with and without polyps and evaluate the potential of the microbiome as a non-invasive biomarker to screen for risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Design Presurgery rectal swab, home collected stool, and sigmoid biopsy samples were obtained from 231 subjects undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy. 16S rRNA analysis was performed on 552 samples (231 rectal swab, 183 stool, 138 biopsy) and operational taxonomic units (OTU) were identified using UPARSE. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to identify OTUs that were significantly different between subjects with and without polyps. These informative OTUs were then used to build classifiers to predict the presence of polyps using advanced machine learning models. Results We obtained clinical data on 218 subjects (87 females, 131 males) of which 193 were White, 21 African-American, and 4 Asian-American. Colonoscopy detected polyps in 56% of subjects. Modelling of the non-invasive home stool samples resulted in a classification accuracy >75% for Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models using informative OTUs. A naïve holdout analysis performed on home stool samples resulted in an average false negative rate of 11.5% for the Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models, which was reduced to 5% when the two models were combined. Conclusion Gut microbiome analysis combined with advanced machine learning represents a promising approach to screen patients for the presence of polyps, with the potential to optimise the use of colonoscopy, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with CRC, and reduce associated healthcare costs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intestinal microbiota plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC), which is crucial for assessing the risk and prognosis of CRC. Most studies regarding human gut microbiota mainly based on the feces, but the exact composition of microbiota vary significantly due to fecal composition is easily affected by many factors. We aim to evaluate whether intestinal lavage fluid (IVF) is a better substitution mirroring the gut microbiota. METHODS: We performed 16S rRNA gene analysis on fecal and IVF samples from 30 CRC patients and 25 healthy individuals, comparison in luminal (feces) / mucosal (IVF) adherent bacterial community profiles were analyzed. RESULTS: The difference between feces and IVF were observed, including the diversity and abundance of pathogenic bacteria (either in single strain or in co-occurrence pattern). IVF group shared 605 OTUs with the fecal group, but there was 94 OTUs only observed in fecal samples, while 247 OTUs were mainly existing in the IVF group. Among them, 27 vital bacterial species detected in IVF, while 10 critical species detected in fecal samples. The co-occurrence bacteria Fusobacteria Cluster and Proteobacteria Cluster 2 significantly increased in IVF than in control (P < .01), while Firmicutes Cluster 1, Firmicutes Cluster 2 and Proteobacteria Cluster 1 were markedly lower in IVF than in control (P < .001). In CRC feces, Fusobacteria Cluster was higher than in control (P < .05), but Firmicutes Cluster 1 was of substantially less abundance than in control (P < .001). Proteobacteria Cluster 2 was increased dramatically in IVF than in feces (P < .05), Firmicutes Cluster 1 were of substantially less abundance than in feces (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Pathogenic microbiota is more abundant in IVF than in feces. Microbiota of IVF may closely be related to the mucosal-associated microbial communities, which benefit from elucidating the relationship of the intestinal microbiota and CRC carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Aim: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis, but compositions of microorganisms have been inconsistent in previous studies due to the different types of specimens. We investigated the microbiomes and resistomes of CRC patients with colonic biopsy tissue and intestinal lavage fluid (IVF). Methods: Paired samples (biopsy tissue and IVF) were collected from 20 patients with CRC, and their gut microbiomes and resistomes were measured by shotgun metagenomics. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. Bioinformatics (KneadData, Kraken2, and FMAP) and statistical analysis were done using the R (v4.0.2) software. Results: Bacterial diversity in IVF was higher than in tissue samples, and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were 2,757 in IVF vs. 197 in tissue. β-diversity showed distinct clusters in paired samples. The predominant bacteria in IVF were phylum Proteobacteria, while the predominant bacteria of tissue were phylum Actinobacteria. Twenty-seven representative bacteria were selected to form six bacterial clusters, which showed only Firmicutes Cluster 1, and the Bacteroidetes Cluster 1 were significantly more abundant in the IVF group than those in the tissue group (p < 0.05). The Firmicutes Cluster 2, Bacteroidetes Cluster 2, Pathogen Cluster, and Prevotella Cluster were not significantly different between IVF and tissue (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that some bacteria could have effects on metabolic and inflammatory parameters of CRC patients. A total of 1,295 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were detected in the gut microbiomes, which conferred multidrug resistance, as well as resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and more. Co-occurrence patterns revealed by the network showed mainly ARG-carrying bacteria to be similar between IVF and tissue, but leading bacteria located in the hub differed between IVF and tissue. Conclusion: Heterogeneity of microbiota is particularly evident when studied with IVF and tissue samples, but bacterial clusters that have close relationships with CRC carcinogenesis are not significantly different, using IVF as an alternative to tissue for gut microbiome, and resistome assessment may be a feasible method.},
