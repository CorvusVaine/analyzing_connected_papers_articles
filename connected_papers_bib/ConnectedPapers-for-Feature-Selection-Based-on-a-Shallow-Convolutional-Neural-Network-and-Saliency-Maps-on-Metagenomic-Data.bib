abstract = {Gut microbiota has been shown to associate with the development of gastrointestinal diseases. In the last decade, development in whole metagenome sequencing and 16S rRNA sequencing technology has dramatically accelerated the gut microbiome's research and revealed its association with gastrointestinal disorders. Because of high dimensionality and complexity's intrinsic data characteristics, traditional bioinformatical methods could only explain the most significant changes with limited prediction accuracy. In contrast, machine learning is the application of artificial intelligence that provides the computational systems to automatically learn and improve from experience (training cohort) without being explicitly programmed. It is thus capable of unwiring high dimensionality and complicated correlational hitches. With modern computation power, machine learning is widely utilized to analyze microorganisms related to disease onset and other clinical features. It could help explore and identify novel biomarkers or improve the accuracy rate of disease diagnostic. This review summarized the most recent research that utilized machine learning to reveal the role of gut microbiota in intestinal disorders.},

Data Visualization is a crucial technique in data analysis to explore and find patterns in data. Especially, data resources from metagenomic often have very high dimension so humans face big challenges to understand them. In this study, we introduce a visualization method based on Mean-shift algorithm which enables us to observe high-dimensional data via images exhibiting clustered features by the clustering method. Then, these generated synthetic images are fetched into a convolutional neural network to do disease prediction tasks. The proposed method shows promising results when we evaluate the approach on four metagenomic bacterial species abundance datasets related to four diseases including Liver Cirrhosis, Colorectal Cancer, Obesity, and Type 2 Diabetes.},

abstract = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been ferociously destroying global health and economics. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), until May 2021, more than one hundred million infected cases and 3.2 million deaths have been reported in over 200 countries. Unfortunately, the numbers are still on the rise. Therefore, scientists are making a significant effort in researching accurate, efficient diagnoses. Several studies advocating artificial intelligence proposed COVID diagnosis methods on lung images with high accuracy. Furthermore, some affected areas in the lung images can be detected accurately by segmentation methods. This work has considered state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures, combined with the Unet family and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for COVID segmentation tasks on Computed Tomography (CT) scanner samples from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology dataset. The experiments show that the decoder-based Unet family has reached the best (a mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of 0.9234, 0.9032 in dice score, and a recall of 0.9349) with a combination between SE ResNeXt and Unet++. The decoder with the Unet family obtained better COVID segmentation performance in comparison with Feature Pyramid Network. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms recent segmentation state-of-the-art approaches such as the SegNet-based network, ADID-UNET, and A-SegNet + FTL. Therefore, it is expected to provide good segmentation visualizations of medical images.},

abstract = {An increasing body of evidence highlights the role of fecal microbiota in various human diseases. However, more than two-thirds of fecal bacteria cannot be cultivated by routine laboratory techniques. Thus, physicians and scientists use DNA sequencing and statistical tools to identify associations between bacterial subgroup abundances and disease. However, discrepancies between studies weaken these results. In the present study, we focus on biases that might account for these discrepancies. First, three different DNA extraction methods (G’NOME, QIAGEN, and PROMEGA) were compared with regard to their efficiency, i.e., the quality and quantity of DNA recovered from feces of 10 healthy volunteers. Then, the impact of the DNA extraction method on the bacteria identification and quantification was evaluated using our published cohort of sample subjected to both 16S rRNA sequencing and whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). WMS taxonomical assignation employed the universal marker genes profiler mOTU-v2, which is considered the gold standard. The three standard pipelines for 16S RNA analysis (MALT and MEGAN6, QIIME1, and DADA2) were applied for comparison. Taken together, our results indicate that the G’NOME-based method was optimal in terms of quantity and quality of DNA extracts. 16S rRNA sequence-based identification of abundant bacteria genera showed acceptable congruence with WMS sequencing, with the DADA2 pipeline yielding the highest congruent levels. However, for low abundance genera (<0.5% of the total abundance) two pipelines and/or validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or WMS are required. Hence, 16S rRNA sequencing for bacteria identification and quantification in clinical and translational studies should be limited to diagnostic purposes in well-characterized and abundant genera. Additional techniques are warranted for low abundant genera, such as WMS, qPCR, or the use of two bio-informatics pipelines.},

 BackgroundCompromised intestinal barrier (CIB) has been associated with many enteropathies, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We hypothesized that CIB could lead to increased host-derived contents including epithelial cells into the gut, change its physio-metabolic properties, and globally alter microbial community and metabolic capacities. ResultsConsistently, we found host DNA contents (HDCs), calculated as the percentage of metagenomic sequencing reads mapped to the host genome, were significantly elevated in patients of CRC and Crohn’s disease (CD). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that HDC correlated with microbial- and metabolic-biomarkers of these diseases, contributed significantly to machine-learning models for patient stratification and was consequently ranked as a top contributor. CD patients with treatment could partially reverse the changes of many CD-signature species over time, with reduced HDC and fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels. Strikingly, HDC showed stronger correlations with the reversing changes of the CD-related species than FCP, and contributed great in classifying treatment responses, suggesting that it was also a biomarker for effective treatment. ConclusionsTogether, we identified a novel biomarker from fecal metagenomics for intestinal diseases and effective treatment; our results also suggested that host-derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota than previously anticipated.},

abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomic sequencing techniques enable quantitative analyses of the microbiome. However, combining the microbial data from these experiments is challenging due to the variations between experiments. The existing methods for correcting batch effects do not consider the interactions between variables—microbial taxa in microbial studies—and the overdispersion of the microbiome data. Therefore, they are not applicable to microbiome data. Results: We develop a new method, Bayesian Dirichlet‐multinomial regression meta‐analysis (BDMMA), to simultaneously model the batch effects and detect the microbial taxa associated with phenotypes. BDMMA automatically models the dependence among microbial taxa and is robust to the high dimensionality of the microbiome and their association sparsity. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that BDMMA can successfully adjust batch effects and substantially reduce false discoveries in microbial meta‐analyses. Availability and implementation: An R package” BDMMA” for Windows and Linux is available at https://github.com/DAIZHENWEI/BDMMA/BDMMA, and a version for MacOS is provided at https://github.com/DAIZHENWEI/BDMMA/BDMMA_MacOS.

abstract = {BackgroundWhole-genome “shotgun” (WGS) metagenomic sequencing is an increasingly widely used tool for analyzing the metagenomic content of microbiome samples. While WGS data contains gene-level information, it can be challenging to analyze the millions of microbial genes which are typically found in microbiome experiments. To mitigate the ultrahigh dimensionality challenge of gene-level metagenomics, it has been proposed to cluster genes by co-abundance to form Co-Abundant Gene groups (CAGs). However, exhaustive co-abundance clustering of millions of microbial genes across thousands of biological samples has previously been intractable purely due to the computational challenge of performing trillions of pairwise comparisons.ResultsHere we present a novel computational approach to the analysis of WGS datasets in which microbial gene groups are the fundamental unit of analysis. We use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor heuristic for near-exhaustive average linkage clustering to group millions of genes by co-abundance. This results in thousands of high-quality CAGs representing complete and partial microbial genomes. We applied this method to publicly available WGS microbiome surveys and found that the resulting microbial CAGs associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) were highly reproducible and could be validated independently using multiple independent cohorts.ConclusionsThis powerful approach to gene-level metagenomics provides a powerful path forward for identifying the biological links between the microbiome and human health. By proposing a new computational approach for handling high dimensional metagenomics data, we identified specific microbial gene groups that are associated with disease that can be used to identify strains of interest for further preclinical and mechanistic experimentation.},

abstract = {The microbiome of the human body has been shown to have profound effects on physiological regulation and disease pathogenesis. However, association analysis based on statistical modeling of microbiome data has continued to be a challenge due to inherent noise, complexity of the data, and high cost of collecting large number of samples. To address this challenge, we employed a deep learning framework to construct a data-driven simulation of microbiome data using a conditional generative adversarial network. Conditional generative adversarial networks train two models against each other while leveraging side information learn from a given dataset to compute larger simulated datasets that are representative of the original dataset. In our study, we used a cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease to show that not only can the generative adversarial network generate samples representative of the original data based on multiple diversity metrics, but also that training machine learning models on the synthetic samples can improve disease prediction through data augmentation. In addition, we also show that the synthetic samples generated by this cohort can boost disease prediction of a different external cohort.},

Methods: This descriptive correlational study was based on the basic psychological needs theory, which is a sub-theory of self-determination theory (SDT). Study participants were 158 inpatients with alcohol use disorder from four mental hospitals in two areas. Data were collected from self-report questionnaires administered in September and October 2019. Data were analyzed using the t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson''s correlation coefficients, and the multiple linear regression with IBM SPSS 22.0. Results: Recovery attitude showed a positive correlation with autonomy (r=.62, p<.001), competence (r=.40, p<.001), and relationship (r=.33, p<.001). The results of the regression indicate the autonomy and competence explained 39% of the recovery attitude (R2=.40, F=51.04, p<.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that autonomy and competence play integral roles in the recovery attitude of inpatients with alcohol use disorders. Thus, mental health practitioners should develop psychological need-based interventions to improve the autonomy, competence, and recovery attitude of inpatients’ with alcohol use disorder.},

abstract = {Background Data on contraceptive needs and use among young unmarried men are limited. Conventional ways of data collection may lead to limited and unreliable information on contraceptive use due to sensitivity of the topic, as many young men feel ashamed to discuss their behavior of using contraceptives. As short message service (SMS) is anonymous and a commonly used means of communication, we believe that if deployed, it will create a promising user-friendly method of data collection. Objective The objective was to investigate the feasibility of using SMS to collect data on sexually active, young, unmarried men’s sexual behavior and contraceptive preferences, practices, and needs in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Moshi, Tanzania. Methods We enrolled men aged 18-30 years who were students (in Ethiopia and Tanzania), taxi or local bus drivers/assistants (Ethiopia and Tanzania), Kilimanjaro porters (Tanzania), or construction workers (Ethiopia). Young men were interviewed using a topic list on contraceptive use. They were followed up for 6 months by sending fortnightly SMS texts with questions about contraceptive use. If the young men indicated that they needed contraceptives during the reporting period or were not satisfied with the method they used, they were invited for a follow-up interview. At the end of the study, we conducted exit interviews telephonically using a semistructured questionnaire to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and accuracy of using SMS to validate the study findings in both countries. Results We enrolled 71 young unmarried men—35 in Tanzania and 36 in Ethiopia. In Moshi, 1908 messages were delivered to participants and 1119 SMS responses were obtained. In Ethiopia, however, only 525 messages were sent to participants and 248 replies were received. The question on dating a girl in the past weeks was asked 438 times in Tanzania and received 252 (58%) replies, of which 148 (59%) were “YES.” In Ethiopia, this question was asked 314 times and received 64 (20%) replies, of which 52 (81%) were “YES” (P=.02 for difference in replies between Tanzania and Ethiopia). In Tanzania, the question on contraceptive use was sent successfully 112 times and received 108 (96%) replies, of which 105 (94%) were “YES.” In Ethiopia, the question on contraceptive use was asked 17 times and received only 2 (11%) replies. Exit interviews in Tanzania showed that SMS was accepted as a means of data collection by 22 (88%) of the 25 interviewed participants. Conclusions Despite network and individual challenges, the SMS system was found to be feasible in Moshi, but not in Addis Ababa. We recommend more research to scale up the method in different groups and regions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
The Kilimanjaro region has one of the highest rates of reported alcohol use per capita in Tanzania. Alcohol-related risky behaviors pose substantial threats to the health and well-being of alcohol users and the people around them. This study seeks to understand how alcohol-related risky behaviors co-occur with other risky behaviors.


METHOD
Latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to examine alcohol-related risky behaviors. The optimal number of latent classes was confirmed by using model fit indices. Negative binomial models were used to test latent classes and their association with harmful and hazardous drinking and perceived alcohol stigma. With the model defined, we explored each class's drinking patterns and risky behavior patterns.


RESULTS
A total of 622 (60% male) of 841 participants were included in these analyses because they drank alcohol at least once in their lifetime. Three classes of risky behavior patterns were identified: Class 1, "Limited risk behaviors" (59.7%); Class 2, "Primarily foolish behaviors" (25.6%); and Class 3, "Pervasive risk behaviors" (13.1%). Class 3 had the most alcohol use quantity and frequency. No association between classes and alcohol stigma was found. Compared with males, females are less likely to be classified in Class 2 and 3.


CONCLUSIONS
Three different classes of risky behaviors became apparent and were distinguished by gender, age, and personal alcohol use. Our findings suggest a potential role for personalized interventions based on latent classes specifically to reduce risk behaviors.},

In this sense, the educational possibilities detected in the cinema are numerous. The pre-service teacher education in the figure of the teacher determines their educational resources. Purpose: The general objective of this study is to design and validate an instrument to measure the perceptions of students of Pre-School Teacher Degree and Primary Teacher Degree in Spanish universities about cinema as a teaching resource in Pre-School and Primary Education. Design/methodology: For this purpose, a systematic and planned process was developed for the design and validation of the Percepciones sobre las potencialidades del cine como recurso didáctico en las aulas de Infantil y Primaria ((PECID) (perceptions about the potentialities of cinema as a didactic resource in pre-school and primary classrooms)) questionnaire. Main findings: The results obtained showed a good content validity of 25 items after an expert judgement. On the other hand, a reliability of the internal consistency of the instrument of 0.978 was obtained. Furthermore, a three-factor structure was confirmed through factor analysis. Conclusions: It is concluded that the PECID questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument to measure the perceptions of future teachers in Spain about using cinema as a resource for future teaching.},

Methods: This descriptive correlational study was based on the basic psychological needs theory, which is a sub-theory of self-determination theory (SDT). Study participants were 158 inpatients with alcohol use disorder from four mental hospitals in two areas. Data were collected from self-report questionnaires administered in September and October 2019. Data were analyzed using the t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and the multiple linear regression with IBM SPSS 22.0. Results: Recovery attitude showed a positive correlation with autonomy (r=.62, p<.001), competence (r=.40, p<.001), and relationship (r=.33, p<.001). The results of the regression indicate the autonomy and competence explained 39% of the recovery attitude (R=.40, F=51.04, p<.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that autonomy and competence play integral roles in the recovery attitude of inpatients with alcohol use disorders. Thus, mental health practitioners should develop psychological need-based interventions to improve the autonomy, competence, and recovery attitude of inpatients’ with alcohol use disorder.},

abstract = {Background: Within the 3Cs (closeness, commitment, and complementarity) theoretical framework of the quality of two-person relationships, a coach–athlete relationship quality questionnaire (CART-Q) was developed and validated to assess the nature of the coach–athlete relationship. In this study, a modified version of the CART-Q for physical education (PE) was adapted to assess the teacher–student relationship quality in the PE context in Turkey and Kuwait. The purpose of this study was to examine the factorial validity of the teacher–student relationship quality questionnaire (TSRQ-PE) within a sample of Turkish and Kuwaiti physical education teachers. Methods: Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) was used to test the measurement of cultural invariance between these two groups. A total of 175 teachers from Turkey (n = 73) and Kuwait (n = 102) completed the TPRQ-PE. Results: MGCFA supported the factorial validity of the TPRQ-PE in a three first-order factor model across the two countries. Overall, these results add evidence to the psychometric properties of the TPRQ-PE and suggest that this instrument can be applied to measure the quality of the teacher–student relationship within Turkey and Kuwait, although caution may be required when applied to drawing comparisons between these two counties. Conclusions: The results of the present study could help physical educators and researchers in this field to understand the reasons and methods that lead to a quality teacher–student relationship.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Harmful alcohol use is a leading risk factor for injury-related death and disability in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Brief negotiational interventions (BNIs) administered in emergency departments (EDs) to injury patients with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are effective in reducing post-hospital alcohol intake and re-injury rates. However, most BNIs to date have been developed and implemented in high-income countries. The efficacy of BNIs in LMICs is largely unknown as few studies have undertaken the rigorous task of culturally adapting these interventions to new settings. Given the high prevalence of alcohol-related injury in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania, we culturally adapted a BNI to reduce post-injury alcohol use for implementation in this patient population. Methods We used an iterative, multiphase process to culturally adapt a high-income country standard of care BNI to the Tanzanian setting using the Intervention Mapping ADAPT framework. Our team consisted of local healthcare professionals with extensive experience in counseling patients who use alcohol, as well as an international team of academic and clinical professionals. Focus groups were used to inform culturally appropriate changes to the standard of care BNI protocol. Objective assessment of BNI delivery was performed to ensure adherence to the FRAMES model of motivational interviewing. Results We developed the Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako (PPKAY); a one-time, 15-minute nurse-led BNI that encourages safe alcohol use and motivates change in alcohol use behaviors among injury patients in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. Adaptations to the original intervention protocol include changes regarding the interventionist, how a patient is greeted, how the topic of alcohol use is raised, how a patient is informed of their harmful alcohol use, how graphics are visualized within the intervention protocol, how behavior change is motivated, and which behavior changes are encouraged. Conclusions The PPKAY intervention is the first BNI to be culturally adapted for delivery to injury patients in an LMIC population. Our study demonstrates a unique approach to adapting substance use interventions for use in LMICs, and shows that cultural adaptation of alcohol use interventions is feasible even in settings where community knowledge regarding harmful alcohol use is limited. Our study prompts the need for further research and cultural adaptation of BNIs for other low-income communities at increased risk of alcohol-related harm.},

abstract = {Problematic drinking has long been established as an important antecedent to the perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV). As little research has evaluated individual differences beyond anger in this association, this research examines problematic drinking and IPV perpetration through the lens of self-determination theory (SDT), the relational perspective suggesting individuals are motivated to be in their relationship for autonomous (i.e., self-driven) and controlled (i.e., guilt-driven) reasons. We test the hypothesis that problematic drinking is more strongly associated with IPV among those who are controlled in their motivation in four independent samples (N = 617). College students in relationships completed measures of alcohol consumption, negative alcohol-related consequences, relationship motivation, and IPV perpetration. Results generally suggested that the association between both alcohol consumption and negative alcohol-related consequences and IPV perpetration is only significant among those endorsing greater controlled motivation. This study supports problematic drinking as not being an equal risk factor for all individuals, and suggests that some people may be more vulnerable to problematic drinking resulting in relationship aggression.},

Methods: A Swahili version of the DrInC was developed by a panel of bilingual Swahili and English speakers through translation and back-translation. The translated DrInC was administered to a sample of Tanzanian injury patients and a sample of the general population. The validity and reliability of the scale were tested using standard statistical methods. Results: The translated version of the DrInC questionnaire was found to have outstanding domain coherence and language clarity. The tested scale and subscales have adequate reliability (>0.85). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the five-factor solution by yielding adequate results. DrInC score is statistically significantly correlated with alcohol consumption quantity and the AUDIT score, suggesting that DrInC is able to predict alcohol use as well. Conclusions: This study presents the first validation of the DrInC questionnaire with injury patients and a general population and the first adaptations of the DrInC questionnaire in the Tanzanian and Swahili setting. DrInC instrument was found to have satisfactory psychometric properties, resulting in a new medical and social research tool in this setting.},

abstract = {Obesity remains a growing public health epidemic that has increased healthcare costs and related comorbidities. Current treatment guidelines encourage a multidisciplinary approach starting from patient selection, interventions, and long-term follow-up to maintain weight loss. However, these conservative interventions are largely ineffective at reducing body weight due to low adherence to the treatment regimen. Recently, endoscopic bariatric therapies have become an attractive alternative to traditional invasive bariatric surgeries due to their improved efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Endoscopic bariatric therapies include intragastric balloon placement, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, gastric bypass revision, and aspiration therapy. These procedures fall into two separate categories depending on the primary mechanism involved: restrictive or malabsorptive. Restrictive methods, such as the Orbera® and ReShape™ intragastric balloons, increase satiation and delay gastric emptying while decreasing the amount of food that can be ingested. In contrast, malabsorptive devices, such as the EndoBarrier®, interfere with the small intestine’s ability to absorb food while restoring normal gastrointestinal hormone levels regulating satiation. Together, these techniques provide useful alternatives for patients in whom pharmacological or lifestyle modifications have proven ineffective. Despite these advantages, the long-term effects of these procedures on metabolic changes remain to be studied. Furthermore, the management of complications from these procedures continues to evolve. In this review, we aim to elaborate on the clinical indications and efficacy of the endobariatric procedures, together with various types of available endoscopic bariatric therapy procedures.},
