abstract = {Association studies have linked microbiome alterations with many human diseases. However, they have not always reported consistent results, thereby necessitating cross-study comparisons. Here, a meta-analysis of eight geographically and technically diverse fecal shotgun metagenomic studies of colorectal cancer (CRC, n = 768), which was controlled for several confounders, identified a core set of 29 species significantly enriched in CRC metagenomes (false discovery rate (FDR) < 1 × 10−5). CRC signatures derived from single studies maintained their accuracy in other studies. By training on multiple studies, we improved detection accuracy and disease specificity for CRC. Functional analysis of CRC metagenomes revealed enriched protein and mucin catabolism genes and depleted carbohydrate degradation genes. Moreover, we inferred elevated production of secondary bile acids from CRC metagenomes, suggesting a metabolic link between cancer-associated gut microbes and a fat- and meat-rich diet. Through extensive validations, this meta-analysis firmly establishes globally generalizable, predictive taxonomic and functional microbiome CRC signatures as a basis for future diagnostics.Cross-study analysis defines fecal microbial species associated with colorectal cancer.},

Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.Multicohort analysis identifies microbial signatures of colorectal cancer in fecal microbiomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS
Stool samples from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have a higher abundance of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius than stool from individuals without CRC, based on metagenome sequencing. We investigated whether P anaerobius contributes to colon tumor formation in mice and its possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis.


METHODS
We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses to measure P anaerobius in 112 stool samples and 255 colon biopsies from patients with CRC or advanced adenoma and from healthy individuals (controls) undergoing colonoscopy examination at hospitals in Hong Kong and Beijing. C57BL/6 mice were given broad-spectrum antibiotics, followed by a single dose of azoxymethane, to induce colon tumor formation. Three days later, mice were given P anaerobius or Esherichia coli MG1655 (control bacteria), via gavage, for 6 weeks. Some mice were also given the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibitor apocynin. Intestine tissues were collected and analyzed histologically. The colon epithelial cell line NCM460 and colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and Caco-2 were exposed to P anaerobius or control bacteria; cells were analyzed by immunoblot, proliferation, and bacterial attachment analyses and compared in gene expression profiling studies. Gene expression was knocked down in these cell lines with small interfering RNAs.


RESULTS
P anaerobius was significantly enriched in stool samples from patients with CRC and in biopsies from patients with colorectal adenoma or CRC compared with controls. Mice depleted of bacteria and exposed to azoxymethane and P anaerobius had a higher incidence of intestinal dysplasia (63%) compared with mice not given the bacteria (8.3%; P < .01). P anaerobius mainly colonized the colon compared with the rest of the intestine. Colon cells exposed to P anaerobius had significantly higher levels of proliferation than control cells. We found genes that regulate cholesterol biosynthesis, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and AMP-activated protein kinase signaling to be significantly up-regulated in cells exposed to P anaerobius. Total cholesterol levels were significantly increased in colon cell lines exposed to P anaerobius via activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2. P anaerobius interacted with TLR2 and TLR4 to increase intracellular levels of reactive oxidative species, which promoted cholesterol synthesis and cell proliferation. Depletion of reactive oxidative species by knockdown of TLR2 or TLR4, or incubation of cells with an antioxidant, prevented P anaerobius from inducing cholesterol biosynthesis and proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
Levels of P anaerobius are increased in human colon tumor tissues and adenomas compared with non-tumor tissues; this bacteria increases colon dysplasia in a mouse model of CRC. P anaerobius interacts with TLR2 and TLR4 on colon cells to increase levels of reactive oxidative species, which promotes cholesterol synthesis and cell proliferation.},

abstract = {An increasing body of evidence highlights the role of fecal microbiota in various human diseases. However, more than two-thirds of fecal bacteria cannot be cultivated by routine laboratory techniques. Thus, physicians and scientists use DNA sequencing and statistical tools to identify associations between bacterial subgroup abundances and disease. However, discrepancies between studies weaken these results. In the present study, we focus on biases that might account for these discrepancies. First, three different DNA extraction methods (G’NOME, QIAGEN, and PROMEGA) were compared with regard to their efficiency, i.e., the quality and quantity of DNA recovered from feces of 10 healthy volunteers. Then, the impact of the DNA extraction method on the bacteria identification and quantification was evaluated using our published cohort of sample subjected to both 16S rRNA sequencing and whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). WMS taxonomical assignation employed the universal marker genes profiler mOTU-v2, which is considered the gold standard. The three standard pipelines for 16S RNA analysis (MALT and MEGAN6, QIIME1, and DADA2) were applied for comparison. Taken together, our results indicate that the G’NOME-based method was optimal in terms of quantity and quality of DNA extracts. 16S rRNA sequence-based identification of abundant bacteria genera showed acceptable congruence with WMS sequencing, with the DADA2 pipeline yielding the highest congruent levels. However, for low abundance genera (<0.5% of the total abundance) two pipelines and/or validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or WMS are required. Hence, 16S rRNA sequencing for bacteria identification and quantification in clinical and translational studies should be limited to diagnostic purposes in well-characterized and abundant genera. Additional techniques are warranted for low abundant genera, such as WMS, qPCR, or the use of two bio-informatics pipelines.},

The study gains additional significance, as India is among the countries with a very low incidence of CRC, and the diet and lifestyle in India have been associated with a distinct gut microbiome in healthy Indians compared to other global populations. Thus, in this study, we hypothesize a unique relationship between CRC and the gut microbiome in an Indian population. ABSTRACT Recently, dysbiosis in the human gut microbiome and shifts in the relative abundances of several bacterial species have been recognized as important factors in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, these studies have been carried out mainly in developed countries where CRC has a high incidence, and it is unclear whether the host-microbiome relationships deduced from these studies can be generalized to the global population. To test if the documented associations between the microbiome and CRC are conserved in a distinct context, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic association studies on fecal samples from 30 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls from two different locations in India, followed by a comparison of CRC data available from other populations. We confirmed the association of Bacteroides and other bacterial taxa with CRC that have been previously reported in other studies. However, the association of CRC with Flavonifractor plautii in Indian patients emerged as a novel finding. The plausible role of F. plautii appears to be linked with the degradation of beneficial anticarcinogenic flavonoids, which was also found to be significantly correlated with the enzymes and modules involved in flavonoid degradation within Indian CRC samples. Thus, we hypothesize that the degradation of beneficial flavonoids might be playing a role in cancer progression within this Indian cohort. We also identified 20 potential microbial taxonomic markers and 33 potential microbial gene markers that discriminate the Indian CRC from healthy microbiomes with high accuracy based on machine learning approaches. IMPORTANCE This study provides novel insights on the CRC-associated microbiome of a unique cohort in India, reveals the potential role of a new bacterium in CRC, and identifies cohort-specific biomarkers, which can potentially be used in noninvasive diagnosis of CRC. The study gains additional significance, as India is among the countries with a very low incidence of CRC, and the diet and lifestyle in India have been associated with a distinct gut microbiome in healthy Indians compared to other global populations.

abstract = {Antibiotics are used for fighting pathogens, but also target our commensal bacteria as a side effect, disturbing the gut microbiota composition and causing dysbiosis and disease1-3. Despite this well-known collateral damage, the activity spectrum of the different antibiotic classes on gut bacteria remains poorly characterized. Having monitored the activities of >1,000 marketed drugs on 38 representative species of the healthy human gut microbiome4, we here characterize further the 144 antibiotics therein, representing all major classes. We determined >800 Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and extended the antibiotic profiling to 10 additional species to validate these results and link to available data on antibiotic breakpoints for gut microbes. Antibiotic classes exhibited distinct inhibition spectra, including generation-dependent effects by quinolones and phylogeny-independence by β-lactams. Macrolides and tetracyclines, two prototypic classes of bacteriostatic protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibited almost all commensals tested. We established that both kill different subsets of prevalent commensal bacteria, and cause cell lysis in specific cases. This species-specific activity challenges the long-standing divide of antibiotics into bactericidal and bacteriostatic, and provides a possible explanation for the strong impact of macrolides on the gut microbiota composition in animals5-8 and humans9-11. To mitigate the collateral damage of macrolides and tetracyclines on gut commensals, we exploited the fact that drug combinations have species-specific outcomes in bacteria12 and sought marketed drugs, which could antagonize the activity of these antibiotics in abundant gut commensal species. By screening >1,000 drugs, we identified several such antidotes capable of protecting gut species from these antibiotics without compromising their activity against relevant pathogens. Altogether, this study broadens our understanding of antibiotic action on gut commensals, uncovers a previously unappreciated and broad bactericidal effect of prototypical bacteriostatic antibiotics on gut bacteria, and opens avenues for preventing the collateral damage caused by antibiotics on human gut commensals.},

The potential use of gut microbes as markers for early diagnosis has also been reported. However, cohort specific noises may distort the structure of microbial dysbiosis in CRC and lead to inconsistent results among studies. In this regard, our study targeted at exploring changes in gut microbiota that are universal across populations at species level.ResultsBased on the combined analysis of 526 metagenomic samples from Chinese, Austrian, American, and German and French cohorts, seven CRC-enriched bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella intermedia, Alistipes finegoldii, and Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans) have been identified across populations. The seven enriched bacterial markers classified cases from controls with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.80 across the different populations. Abundance correlation analysis demonstrated that CRC-enriched and CRC-depleted bacteria respectively formed their own mutualistic networks, in which the latter was disjointed in CRC. The CRC-enriched bacteria have been found to be correlated with lipopolysaccharide and energy biosynthetic pathways.ConclusionsOur study identified potential diagnostic bacterial markers that are robust across populations, indicating their potential universal use for non-invasive CRC diagnosis.

 BackgroundCompromised intestinal barrier (CIB) has been associated with many enteropathies, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We hypothesized that CIB could lead to increased host-derived contents including epithelial cells into the gut, change its physio-metabolic properties, and globally alter microbial community and metabolic capacities. ResultsConsistently, we found host DNA contents (HDCs), calculated as the percentage of metagenomic sequencing reads mapped to the host genome, were significantly elevated in patients of CRC and Crohn’s disease (CD). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that HDC correlated with microbial- and metabolic-biomarkers of these diseases, contributed significantly to machine-learning models for patient stratification and was consequently ranked as a top contributor. CD patients with treatment could partially reverse the changes of many CD-signature species over time, with reduced HDC and fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels. Strikingly, HDC showed stronger correlations with the reversing changes of the CD-related species than FCP, and contributed great in classifying treatment responses, suggesting that it was also a biomarker for effective treatment. ConclusionsTogether, we identified a novel biomarker from fecal metagenomics for intestinal diseases and effective treatment; our results also suggested that host-derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota than previously anticipated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS
Altered gut microbiota is implicated in development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Some intestinal bacteria have been reported to potentiate intestinal carcinogenesis by producing genotoxins, altering the immune response and intestinal microenvironment, and activating oncogenic signaling pathways. We investigated whether stool from patients with CRC could directly induce colorectal carcinogenesis in mice.


METHODS
We obtained stored stool samples from participants in a metagenome study performed in Hong Kong. Conventional (male C57BL/6) mice were given azoxymethane to induce colon neoplasia after receiving a course of antibiotics in drinking water. Mice were gavaged twice weekly with stool from 5 patients with CRC or 5 healthy individuals (controls) for 5 weeks. Germ-free C57BL/6 mice were gavaged once with stool from 5 patients with CRC or 5 controls. We collected intestinal tissues from mice and performed histology, immunohistochemistry, expression microarray, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and flow cytometry analyses. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis of feces from mice.


RESULTS
Significantly higher proportions of conventional mice fed with stool from individuals with CRC than control stool developed high-grade dysplasia (P < .05) and macroscopic polyps (P < .01). We observed a higher proportion of proliferating (Ki-67-positive) cells in colons of germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC vs those fed with stool from controls (P < .05). Feces from germ-free and conventional mice fed with stool from patients with CRC vs controls contained different microbial compositions, with lower richness in mice fed with stool from patients with CRC. Intestines collected from conventional and germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC had increased expression of cytokines that modulate inflammation, including C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2, interleukin 17A (IL17A), IL22, and IL23A. Intestines from conventional and germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC contained higher proportions of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (2.25% vs 0.44%) and Th17 cells (2.08% vs 0.31%) (P < .05 for each) than mice fed with stool from controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction arrays revealed up-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, stemness, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis in mice fed with stool from patients with CRC.


CONCLUSIONS
We fed stool samples from patients with CRC and heathy individuals to germ-free mice and conventional mice with azoxymethane. We found stool from patients with CRC to increase the numbers of polyps, levels of intestinal dysplasia and proliferation, markers of inflammation, and proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells in colon, compared with stool from individuals without CRC.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) causes high morbidity and mortality worldwide, and noninvasive gut microbiome (GM) biomarkers are promising for early CRC diagnosis. However, the GM varies significantly based on ethnicity, diet and living environment, suggesting varied GM biomarker performance in different regions. We performed a metagenomic association analysis on stools from 52 patients and 55 corresponding healthy family members who lived together to identify GM biomarkers for CRC in Chongqing, China. The GM of patients differed significantly from that of healthy controls. A total of 22 microbial genes were included as screening biomarkers with high accuracy in additional 46 cases and 40 randomly selected healthy adults in Chongqing (area under the receive-operation curve (AUC) = 0.905, 95% CI 0.832–0.977). The classifier based on the identified 22 biomarkers also performed well in the cohort from Hong Kong (AUC = 0.811, 95% CI 0.715–0.907) and French (AUC = 0.859, 95% CI 0.773–0.944) populations. Quantitative PCR was applied for measuring three selected biomarkers in the classification of CRC patients in independent Chongqing population containing 30 cases and 30 controls and the best biomarker from Coprobacillus performed well with high AUC (0.930, 95% CI 0.904–0.955). This study revealed increased sensitivity and applicability of our GM biomarkers compared with previous biomarkers significantly promoting the early diagnosis of CRC.},

abstract = {Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces CRC incidence and mortality. However, current screening methods are either hampered by invasiveness or suboptimal performance, limiting their effectiveness as primary screening methods. To aid in the development of a non-invasive screening test with improved sensitivity and specificity, we have initiated a prospective biomarker study (CRCbiome), nested within a large randomized CRC screening trial in Norway. We aim to develop a microbiome-based classification algorithm to identify advanced colorectal lesions in screening participants testing positive for an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT). We will also examine interactions with host factors, diet, lifestyle and prescription drugs. The prospective nature of the study also enables the analysis of changes in the gut microbiome following the removal of precancerous lesions. Methods: The CRCbiome study recruits participants enrolled in the Bowel Cancer Screening in Norway (BCSN) study, a randomized trial initiated in 2012 comparing once-only sigmoidoscopy to repeated biennial FIT, where women and men aged 50-74 years at study entry are invited to participate. Since 2017, participants randomized to FIT screening with a positive test result have been invited to join the CRCbiome study. Self-reported diet, lifestyle and demographic data are collected prior to colonoscopy after the positive FIT-test (baseline). Screening data, including colonoscopy findings are obtained from the BCSN database. Fecal samples for gut microbiome analyses are collected both before and 2 and 12 months after colonoscopy. Samples are analyzed using metagenome sequencing, with taxonomy profiles, and gene and pathway content as primary measures. CRCbiome data will also be linked to national registries to obtain information on prescription histories and cancer relevant outcomes occurring during the 10 year follow-up period. Discussion: The CRCbiome study will increase our understanding of how the gut microbiome, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, influences the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. This knowledge will be crucial to develop microbiome-based screening tools for CRC. By evaluating biomarker performance in a screening setting, using samples from the target population, the generalizability of the findings to future screening cohorts is likely to be high.},

We hypothesized that compromised intestinal barrier (CIB) could lead to increased host-derived contents including human cells in the gut, change its physio-metabolic properties, and globally alter gut microbiota and their metabolic capacities.Consistently, we found human DNA contents (HDCs), calculated as the percentage of metagenomic sequencing reads mapped to the human genome, were significantly elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; HDC correlated with microbial- and metabolic-pathway-biomarkers of CRC, and was the most important contributor to patient stratification. We found similar results in Crohn’s disease (CD); additionally, patients treated with diet and drug intervention showed reduced HDC levels over time, and were accompanied by reversing changes of many CD-signature species.Our results suggested that host-derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota than previously anticipated, and CIB could be an ideal treatment target that could reverse dysbiosis globally and precisely.},

We show that disease-microbiome associations display specific age-centric trends. Ageing-associated microbiome alterations towards a disease-like configuration occur in colorectal cancer patients, thereby masking disease signatures. We identified a microbiome disease response shared across multiple diseases in elderly subjects that is distinct from that in young/middle-aged individuals, but also a novel set of taxa consistently gained in disease across all age groups. A subset of these taxa was associated with increased frailty in subjects from the ELDERMET cohort. The relevant taxa differentially encode specific functions that are known to have disease associations.},

abstract = {The association of colorectal cancer (CRC) and the human gut microbiome dysbiosis has been the focus of several studies in the past. Many bacterial taxa have been shown to have differential abundance among CRC patients compared to healthy controls. However, the relationship between CRC and non-bacterial gut microbiome such as the gut virome is under-studied and not well understood. In this study we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the association of viral abundances with CRC using metagenomic shotgun sequencing data of 462 CRC subjects and 449 healthy controls from 7 studies performed in 8 different countries. Despite the high heterogeneity, our results showed that the virome alpha diversity was consistently higher in CRC patients than in healthy controls (p-value <0.001). This finding is in sharp contrast to previous reports of low alpha diversity of prokaryotes in CRC compared to healthy controls. In addition to the previously known association of Podoviridae, Siphoviridae and Myoviridae with CRC, we further demonstrate that Herelleviridae, a newly constructed viral family, is significantly depleted in CRC subjects. Our interkingdom association analysis reveals a less intertwined correlation between the gut virome and bacteriome in CRC compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we show that the viral abundance profiles can be used to accurately predict CRC disease status (AUROC >0.8) in both within-study and cross-study settings. The combination of training sets resulted in rather generalized and accurate prediction models. Our study clearly shows that subjects with colorectal cancer harbor a distinct human gut virome profile which may have an important role in this disease.},

abstract = {BackgroundWhole-genome “shotgun” (WGS) metagenomic sequencing is an increasingly widely used tool for analyzing the metagenomic content of microbiome samples. While WGS data contains gene-level information, it can be challenging to analyze the millions of microbial genes which are typically found in microbiome experiments. To mitigate the ultrahigh dimensionality challenge of gene-level metagenomics, it has been proposed to cluster genes by co-abundance to form Co-Abundant Gene groups (CAGs). However, exhaustive co-abundance clustering of millions of microbial genes across thousands of biological samples has previously been intractable purely due to the computational challenge of performing trillions of pairwise comparisons.ResultsHere we present a novel computational approach to the analysis of WGS datasets in which microbial gene groups are the fundamental unit of analysis. We use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor heuristic for near-exhaustive average linkage clustering to group millions of genes by co-abundance. This results in thousands of high-quality CAGs representing complete and partial microbial genomes. We applied this method to publicly available WGS microbiome surveys and found that the resulting microbial CAGs associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) were highly reproducible and could be validated independently using multiple independent cohorts.ConclusionsThis powerful approach to gene-level metagenomics provides a powerful path forward for identifying the biological links between the microbiome and human health. By proposing a new computational approach for handling high dimensional metagenomics data, we identified specific microbial gene groups that are associated with disease that can be used to identify strains of interest for further preclinical and mechanistic experimentation.},

abstract = {Machine learning-based classification approaches are widely used to predict host phenotypes from microbiome data. Classifiers are typically employed by considering operational taxonomic units or relative abundance profiles as input features. Such types of data are intrinsically sparse, which opens the opportunity to make predictions from the presence/absence rather than the relative abundance of microbial taxa. This also poses the question whether it is the presence rather than the abundance of particular taxa to be relevant for discrimination purposes, an aspect that has been so far overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by performing a meta-analysis on 4,128 publicly available metagenomes associated with multiple case-control studies. At species-level taxonomic resolution, we show that it is the presence rather than the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa to be important when building classification models. Such findings are robust to the choice of the classifier and confirmed by statistical tests applied to identifying differentially abundant/present taxa. Results are further confirmed at coarser taxonomic resolutions and validated on 4,026 additional 16S rRNA samples coming from 30 public case-control studies.},

abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomic sequencing techniques enable quantitative analyses of the microbiome. However, combining the microbial data from these experiments is challenging due to the variations between experiments. The existing methods for correcting batch effects do not consider the interactions between variables—microbial taxa in microbial studies—and the overdispersion of the microbiome data. Therefore, they are not applicable to microbiome data. Results: We develop a new method, Bayesian Dirichlet‐multinomial regression meta‐analysis (BDMMA), to simultaneously model the batch effects and detect the microbial taxa associated with phenotypes. BDMMA automatically models the dependence among microbial taxa and is robust to the high dimensionality of the microbiome and their association sparsity. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that BDMMA can successfully adjust batch effects and substantially reduce false discoveries in microbial meta‐analyses.

 Background Gut microbiome is gaining interest because its links with several diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Results Here we performed a meta-analysis of 851 fecal metagenomic samples from five publicly available studies. We used an interpretable machine learning approach based on functional profiles, instead of the conventional taxonomic profiles, to produce a highly accurate predictor of CRC with better precision than those of previous proposals. Moreover, this approach is also able to discriminate samples with adenoma, which makes this approach very promising for CRC prevention by detecting early stages in which intervention is easier and more effective. In addition, interpretable machine learning methods allows extracting features relevant for the classification, which reveals basic molecular mechanisms accounting for the changes underwent by the microbiome functional landscape in the transition from healthy gut to adenoma and CRC conditions. Conclusion Functional profiles provide superior accuracy in predicting CCR and adenoma conditions than taxonomic profiles and additionally, in a context of explainable machine learning, provide useful hints on the molecular mechanisms operating in the microbiota behind these conditions.},

The random forests (RF) classification algorithm was then used to predict colorectal cancer status based on the microbial relative abundance profiles. Based on within data cross-validation and cross-dataset prediction, we show that the RF prediction performance using the microbial relative abundance profiles estimated by Centrifuge is generally higher than that using the microbial relative abundance profiles estimated by MetaPhlAn2 and Bracken. We also develop a novel method to integrate the relative abundance profiles of both known and novel microbial organisms to further increase the prediction performance for colorectal cancer from metagenomes.},

abstract = {Gut microbes have been identified as potential markers in distinguishing patients from controls in colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease individually, whereas there lacks a systematic analysis to investigate the exclusive microbial shifts of these enteropathies with similar clinical symptoms. Our meta-analysis and cross-disease comparisons identified consistent microbial alterations in each enteropathy, revealed microbial ecosystems among marker bacteria in distinct states, and demonstrated the necessity and feasibility of metagenome-based multidisease classifications. ABSTRACT Common intestinal diseases such as Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) share clinical symptoms and altered gut microbes, necessitating cross-disease comparisons and the use of multidisease models. Here, we performed meta-analyses on 13 fecal metagenome data sets of the three diseases. We identified 87 species and 65 pathway markers that were consistently changed in multiple data sets of the same diseases. According to their overall trends, we grouped the disease-enriched marker species into disease-specific and disease-common clusters and revealed their distinct phylogenetic relationships; species in the CD-specific cluster were phylogenetically related, while those in the CRC-specific cluster were more distant. Strikingly, UC-specific species were phylogenetically closer to CRC, likely because UC patients have higher risk of CRC. Consistent with their phylogenetic relationships, marker species had similar within-cluster and different between-cluster metabolic preferences. A portion of marker species and pathways correlated with an indicator of leaky gut, suggesting a link between gut dysbiosis and human-derived contents. Marker species showed more coordinated changes and tighter inner-connections in cases than the controls, suggesting that the diseased gut may represent a stressed environment and pose stronger selection on gut microbes. With the marker species and pathways, we constructed four high-performance (including multidisease) models with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.87 and true-positive rates up to 90%, and explained their putative clinical applications. We identified consistent microbial alterations in common intestinal diseases, revealed metabolic capacities and the relationships among marker bacteria in distinct states, and supported the feasibility of metagenome-derived multidisease diagnosis. IMPORTANCE Gut microbes have been identified as potential markers in distinguishing patients from controls in colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease individually, whereas there lacks a systematic analysis to investigate the exclusive microbial shifts of these enteropathies with similar clinical symptoms. Our meta-analysis and cross-disease comparisons identified consistent microbial alterations in each enteropathy, revealed microbial ecosystems among marker bacteria in distinct states, and demonstrated the necessity and feasibility of metagenome-based multidisease classifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct multiclass models for these common intestinal diseases.},

abstract = {Objective Fusobacteria are not common nor relatively abundant in non-colorectal cancer (CRC) populations, however, we identified multiple Fusobacterium taxa nearly absent in western and rural populations to be comparatively more prevalent and relatively abundant in southern Chinese populations. We investigated whether these represented known or novel lineages in the Fusobacterium genus, and assessed their genomes for features implicated in development of cancer. Methods Prevalence and relative abundances of fusobacterial species were calculated from 3157 CRC and non-CRC gut metagenomes representing 16 populations from various biogeographies. Microbial genomes were assembled and compared with existing reference genomes to assess novel fusobacterial diversity. Phylogenetic distribution of virulence genes implicated in CRC was investigated. Results Irrespective of CRC disease status, southern Chinese populations harboured increased prevalence (maximum 39% vs 7%) and relative abundances (average 0.4% vs 0.04% of gut community) of multiple recognised and novel fusobacterial taxa phylogenetically distinct from Fusobacterium nucleatum. Genomes assembled from southern Chinese gut metagenomes increased existing fusobacterial diversity by 14.3%. Homologues of the FadA adhesin linked to CRC were consistently detected in several monophyletic lineages sister to and inclusive of F. varium and F. ulcerans, but not F. mortiferum. We also detected increased prevalence and relative abundances of F. varium in CRC compared with non-CRC cohorts, which together with distribution of FadA homologues supports a possible association with gut disease. Conclusion The proportion of fusobacteria in guts of southern Chinese populations are higher compared with several western and rural populations in line with the notion of environment/biogeography driving human gut microbiome composition. Several non-nucleatum taxa possess FadA homologues and were enriched in CRC cohorts; whether this imposes a risk in developing CRC and other gut diseases deserves further investigation.},

abstract = {Gut microbiota has been shown to associate with the development of gastrointestinal diseases. In the last decade, development in whole metagenome sequencing and 16S rRNA sequencing technology has dramatically accelerated the gut microbiome's research and revealed its association with gastrointestinal disorders. Because of high dimensionality and complexity's intrinsic data characteristics, traditional bioinformatical methods could only explain the most significant changes with limited prediction accuracy. In contrast, machine learning is the application of artificial intelligence that provides the computational systems to automatically learn and improve from experience (training cohort) without being explicitly programmed. It is thus capable of unwiring high dimensionality and complicated correlational hitches. With modern computation power, machine learning is widely utilized to analyze microorganisms related to disease onset and other clinical features. It could help explore and identify novel biomarkers or improve the accuracy rate of disease diagnostic. This review summarized the most recent research that utilized machine learning to reveal the role of gut microbiota in intestinal disorders.},

abstract = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been ferociously destroying global health and economics. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), until May 2021, more than one hundred million infected cases and 3.2 million deaths have been reported in over 200 countries. Unfortunately, the numbers are still on the rise. Therefore, scientists are making a significant effort in researching accurate, efficient diagnoses. Several studies advocating artificial intelligence proposed COVID diagnosis methods on lung images with high accuracy. Furthermore, some affected areas in the lung images can be detected accurately by segmentation methods. This work has considered state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures, combined with the Unet family and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for COVID segmentation tasks on Computed Tomography (CT) scanner samples from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology dataset. The experiments show that the decoder-based Unet family has reached the best (a mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of 0.9234, 0.9032 in dice score, and a recall of 0.9349) with a combination between SE ResNeXt and Unet++. The decoder with the Unet family obtained better COVID segmentation performance in comparison with Feature Pyramid Network. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms recent segmentation state-of-the-art approaches such as the SegNet-based network, ADID-UNET, and A-SegNet + FTL. Therefore, it is expected to provide good segmentation visualizations of medical images.},

abstract = {Personalized medicine can be defined as the adaptation of medical treatments to the specific characteristics of patients. This approach allows health providers to develop therapies and interventions by taking into account the heterogeneity of illnesses and external factors such as the environment, patients’ needs, and lifestyle. Technology could play an important role to achieve this new approach to medicine. An example of technology’s utility regards real-time monitoring of individual well-being (subjective and objective), in order to improve disease management through data-driven personalized treatment recommendations. Another important example is an interface designed based on patient’s capabilities and preferences. These could improve patient-doctor communication: on one hand, patients have the possibility to improve health decision-making; on the other hand, health providers could coordinate care services more easily, because of continual access to patient’s data. This contribution deepens these technologies and related opportunities for health, as well as recommendation for successful development and implementation.},

In this paper, we compared disease prediction performance of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and conventional learning algorithms in combination with missing value prediction methods. As a result, the highest accuracy of 98.05% was obtained using stacked autoencoder as the missing value prediction method and auxiliary classifier GANs (AC-GANs) as the disease predicting method. Results show that the combination of stacked autoencoder and AC-GANs performs significantly greater than existing algorithms at the problem of disease prediction in which missing values and class imbalance exist.},

abstract = {Gut microbiome is gaining interest because of its links with several diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as the possibility of being used to obtain non-intrusive predictive disease biomarkers. Here we performed a meta-analysis of 1042 fecal metagenomic samples from seven publicly available studies. We used an interpretable machine learning approach based on functional profiles, instead of the conventional taxonomic profiles, to produce a highly accurate predictor of CRC with better precision than those of previous proposals. Moreover, this approach is also able to discriminate samples with adenoma, which makes this approach very promising for CRC prevention by detecting early stages in which intervention is easier and more effective. In addition, interpretable machine learning methods allow extracting features relevant for the classification, which reveals basic molecular mechanisms accounting for the changes undergone by the microbiome functional landscape in the transition from healthy gut to adenoma and CRC conditions. Functional profiles have demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting CRC and adenoma conditions than taxonomic profiles and additionally, in a context of explainable machine learning, provide useful hints on the molecular mechanisms operating in the microbiota behind these conditions.},

abstract = {The microbiome of the human body has been shown to have profound effects on physiological regulation and disease pathogenesis. However, association analysis based on statistical modeling of microbiome data has continued to be a challenge due to inherent noise, complexity of the data, and high cost of collecting large number of samples. To address this challenge, we employed a deep learning framework to construct a data-driven simulation of microbiome data using a conditional generative adversarial network. Conditional generative adversarial networks train two models against each other while leveraging side information learn from a given dataset to compute larger simulated datasets that are representative of the original dataset. In our study, we used a cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease to show that not only can the generative adversarial network generate samples representative of the original data based on multiple diversity metrics, but also that training machine learning models on the synthetic samples can improve disease prediction through data augmentation. In addition, we also show that the synthetic samples generated by this cohort can boost disease prediction of a different external cohort.},
