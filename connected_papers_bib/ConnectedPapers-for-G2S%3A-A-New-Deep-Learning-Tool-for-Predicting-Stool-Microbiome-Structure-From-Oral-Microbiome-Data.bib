abstract = {Deep learning methodologies have revolutionized prediction in many fields and show the potential to do the same in microbial metagenomics. However, deep learning is still unexplored in the field of microbiology, with only a few software designed to work with microbiome data. Within the meta-community theory, we foresee new perspectives for the development and application of deep learning algorithms in the field of the human microbiome. In this context, we developed G2S, a bioinformatic tool for taxonomic prediction of the human fecal microbiome directly from the oral microbiome data of the same individual. The tool uses a deep convolutional neural network trained on paired oral and fecal samples from populations across the globe, which allows inferring the stool microbiome at the family level more accurately than other available approaches. The tool can be used in retrospective studies, where fecal sampling was not performed, and especially in the field of paleomicrobiology, as a unique opportunity to recover data related to ancient gut microbiome configurations. G2S was validated on already characterized oral and fecal sample pairs, and then applied to ancient microbiome data from dental calculi, to derive putative intestinal components in medieval subjects.},

abstract = {The human gut microbiota is impacted by host nutrition and health status and therefore represents a potentially adaptive phenotype influenced by metabolic and immune constraints. Previous studies contrasting rural populations in developing countries to urban industrialized ones have shown that industrialization is strongly correlated with patterns in human gut microbiota; however, we know little about the relative contribution of factors such as climate, diet, medicine, hygiene practices, host genetics, and parasitism. Here, we focus on fine-scale comparisons of African rural populations in order to (i) contrast the gut microbiota of populations inhabiting similar environments but having different traditional subsistence modes and either shared or distinct genetic ancestry, and (ii) examine the relationship between gut parasites and bacterial communities. Characterizing the fecal microbiota of Pygmy hunter-gatherers as well as Bantu individuals from both farming and fishing populations in Southwest Cameroon, we found that the gut parasite Entamoeba is significantly correlated with microbiome composition and diversity. We show that across populations, colonization by this protozoa can be predicted with 79% accuracy based on the composition of an individual's gut microbiota, and that several of the taxa most important for distinguishing Entamoeba absence or presence are signature taxa for autoimmune disorders. We also found gut communities to vary significantly with subsistence mode, notably with some taxa previously shown to be enriched in other hunter-gatherers groups (in Tanzania and Peru) also discriminating hunter-gatherers from neighboring farming or fishing populations in Cameroon. Author Summary The community of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract plays a critical role in determining human health. It’s been hypothesized that the industrialized lifestyle, marked by a diet rich in processed foods, higher use of antibiotics, increased hygiene, and exposure to various chemicals, has altered microbiota in ways that are harmful. Studies have addressed this by comparing rural and industrialized populations, and have found that they systematically vary in their gut microbiome composition. Nevertheless, the relative influence of host genetics, diet, climate, medication, hygiene practices, and parasitism is still not clear. In addition, microbial variation between nearby human populations has not been explored in depth. Moreover, The World Health Organization estimates that 24% of the world’s population, concentrated in developing countries, is infected with gut parasites. Despite this, and evidence for direct interactions between the immune system and both gut parasites and bacteria, we know relatively little about the relationship between gut helminths, protozoa, and bacteria. In our study, we aimed to address some of this complexity. To do so, we characterized the gut microbial communities and parasites from Pygmy hunter-gatherer and Bantu farming and fishing populations from seven locations in the rainforest of Southwest Cameroon. We found that both subsistence mode and the presence of the gut protozoa, Entamoeba, were significantly correlated with microbiome composition. These findings support previous studies demonstrating diet is an important determinant of gut microbiota, and further show that this pattern holds true at a local scale, in traditional societies inhabiting a similar environment. Additionally, we show a significant relationship between a common human parasite (Entamoeba) and gut bacterial community composition, suggesting potential important interactions between the immune system, gut bacteria, and gut parasites, highlighting the need for more hierarchical cross population studies that include parasitism as potential factor influencing gut microbiota dynamics.},

abstract = {Significance Machine learning methodologies can be applied readily to biological problems, but standard training and testing methods are not designed to control for evolutionary relatedness or other biological phenomena. In this article, we propose, implement, and test two methods to control for and utilize evolutionary relatedness within a predictive deep learning framework. The methods are tested and applied within the context of predicting mRNA expression levels from whole-genome DNA sequence data and are applicable across biological organisms. Potential use cases for the methods include plant and animal breeding, disease research, gene editing, and others. Deep learning methodologies have revolutionized prediction in many fields and show potential to do the same in molecular biology and genetics. However, applying these methods in their current forms ignores evolutionary dependencies within biological systems and can result in false positives and spurious conclusions. We developed two approaches that account for evolutionary relatedness in machine learning models: (i) gene-family–guided splitting and (ii) ortholog contrasts. The first approach accounts for evolution by constraining model training and testing sets to include different gene families. The second approach uses evolutionarily informed comparisons between orthologous genes to both control for and leverage evolutionary divergence during the training process. The two approaches were explored and validated within the context of mRNA expression level prediction and have the area under the ROC curve (auROC) values ranging from 0.75 to 0.94. Model weight inspections showed biologically interpretable patterns, resulting in the hypothesis that the 3′ UTR is more important for fine-tuning mRNA abundance levels while the 5′ UTR is more important for large-scale changes.},

abstract = {Through human microbiome sequencing, we can better understand how host evolutionary and ontogenetic history is reflected in the microbial function. However, there has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in hunter-gatherer populations, posing a gap in our knowledge of gut microbiota (GM)-host mutualism arising from a lifestyle that describes over 90% of human evolutionary history. Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that aligns with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad-spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Resistome functionality demonstrates the existence of antibiotic resistance genes in a population with little antibiotic exposure, indicating the ubiquitous presence of environmentally derived resistances. Our results demonstrate how the functional specificity of the GM correlates with certain environment and lifestyle factors and how complexity from the exogenous environment can be balanced by endogenous homeostasis. The Hadza gut metagenome structure allows us to appreciate the co-adaptive functional role of the GM in complementing the human physiology, providing a better understanding of the versatility of human life and subsistence.},

Here we examine the relationship between lifeways and gut microbiota through taxonomic and functional potential characterization of faecal samples from hunter-gatherer and traditional agriculturalist communities in Peru and an urban-industrialized community from the US. We find that in addition to taxonomic and metabolic differences between urban and traditional lifestyles, hunter-gatherers form a distinct sub-group among traditional peoples. As observed in previous studies, we find that Treponema are characteristic of traditional gut microbiomes. Moreover, through genome reconstruction (2.2–2.5 MB, coverage depth × 26–513) and functional potential characterization, we discover these Treponema are diverse, fall outside of pathogenic clades and are similar to Treponema succinifaciens, a known carbohydrate metabolizer in swine. Gut Treponema are found in non-human primates and all traditional peoples studied to date, suggesting they are symbionts lost in urban-industrialized societies.},

abstract = {The importance of gut microbiome in influencing human health has been widely assessed. The gut microbiome may vary according to several extrinsic factors, among which diet can be considered one of the most important. Substrates provided through diet are metabolized by the gut microbiome, with the possible production of beneficial or harmful metabolites. In the past decades, dietary habits in the Western world have strongly changed, with an increase in the consumption of foods of animal origin and a decrease in the intake of fiber and complex polysaccharides. These changes in the diet impacted our microbial symbionts, possibly playing a role in the development of several diseases. The understanding of these relationships will allow, in a next future, a targeted modulation of the gut microbiome through ad hoc dietary interventions for therapeutic or preventive purposes. In this chapter, recent findings about the existing interconnections between gut microbiome, diet, and human health are discussed, highlighting possible future perspectives.},

abstract = {The progressive reduction of gut microbiome (GM) biodiversity along human evolutionary history has been found to be particularly exacerbated in Western urban compared to traditional rural populations, and supposed to contribute to the increasing incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases. Together with sanitation, antibiotics and C-section, the Western diets, low in microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) while rich in industrialized and processed foods, are considered one of the leading causes of this shrinkage. However, significant questions remain unanswered, especially whether high-MAC low-processed diets may be sufficient to recover GM diversity in Western urban populations. Here, we profiled the GM structure of urban Italian subjects adhering to the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD), a dietary pattern featured by high consumption of MACs and low-to-zero intake of refined sugars and processed foods, and compared data with other Italian individuals following a Mediterranean Diet (MD), as well as worldwide traditional hunter-gatherer populations from previous publications. Notwithstanding a strong geography effect on the GM structure, our results show an unexpectedly high degree of GM biodiversity in MPD subjects, which well approximates that of traditional populations. Increasing the consumption of MACs at the expense of refined sugars, and minimizing the intake of processed foods, both hallmarks of the MPD, could be the key to rewild the Western microbiota, counteracting the loss of GM diversity and thus restoring evolutionarily important functionality to our gut for improved human health.},

The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of an engineered bacteria with expression of GLP-1 on obese mice induced by high fat diet (HFD). Methods The engineered strain of MG1363-pMG36e-GLP-1 (M-GLP-1) was constructed and its anti-obesity effects were evaluated in vivo. The bodyweight, the morphology of adipose and liver tissue, and liver function were examined. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure the expressions of the genes involved in fatty acid oxidation synthesis. The intestinal microbial diversity was detected with high-throughput sequencing analysis. Results The engineered bacteria could produce GLP-1. It also significantly decreased the bodyweight and improved the glucose intolerance in the obese mice induced by HFD. Moreover, the strain also reduced the triglyceride (TG) in serum, protected liver, as well as decreased the intracellular TG in liver tissues of the obese mice. Furthermore, our results showed that the expressions of the genes including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α (PPARα) and its target genes were enhanced in liver tissues when mice treated with M-GLP-1. Finally, we found that the engineered strain markedly increased intestinal microbial diversity. Conclusion Our results suggested the genetically engineered bacteria that constitutively secreted GLP-1 could improve obesity and the mechanism may be related to promoting fatty acid oxidation and increasing intestinal microbial diversity of the obese mice.},

abstract = {The co-evolution of the gut microbiota with its human host has revolutionized our current scientific viewpoint about the contribution of diet and lifestyle on human health. Most studies so far have focused on populations living in the United States and Europe or compared those with communities from other geographic areas in the world. In order to determine the taxonomic and predicted functional profile of the gut microbiome of a hitherto unstudied human community, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the gut microbiota in a community of Fulani nomadic pastoralists, and their semi-urbanized neighbors – the Jarawa. The Jarawa reside in a city (Jos) in the north-central part of Nigeria, and are adapted in part to a westernized lifestyle. The nomadic Fulani lifestyle resembles a mix of Paleolithic and Neolithic lifestyle patterns with a greater predisposition to diseases. The fecal microbiota of the Fulani and the Jarawa were characterized by paired-end Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by downstream bioinformatics analysis of the sequence reads. The Fulani harbored increased numbers of signatures of microbes that are known to be associated with a foraging lifestyle such as the Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Prevotellaceae, while the Jarawa were dominated by signatures of Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Christensenellaceae. Notably, the gut microbiota of the Fulani showed less taxonomic diversity than those of the Jarawa. Although they reside in the same geographical zone, microbial community composition was significantly different between the two groups. Pathogens were predicted to be more abundant in the gut microbiota of the Fulani than of the Jarawa. Predicted pathogenic pathways and pathways associated with the breakdown of fiber-rich diet were enriched in the Fulani, including glutathione metabolism, while pathways associated with the consumption of low-fiber diet and xenobiotics, including fructose and mannose metabolic pathways, and nitrotoluene degradation pathways, respectively, were enriched in the Jarawa. Significant differences in composition between both groups were likely due to differences in diet and lifestyle and exposure to pathogens. These results suggest that microbial diversity may not always be higher in non-industrialized societies than in westernized societies, as previously assumed.},

The Yanomami is the largest semi-nomadic hunter–gatherer group of the Americas, exploring different niches of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Venezuela. Here, based on shotgun metagenomic data, we characterized the gut microbiome of the Yanomami from Brazil and compared taxonomically and functionally with the Yanomami from Venezuela, with other traditional groups from the Amazon and an urban-industrialized group. Taxonomic biomarkers were identified to each South American traditional group studied, including each Yanomami group. Broader levels of functional categories poorly discriminated the traditional and urban-industrialized groups, but the stratification of these categories revealed clear segregation of these groups. The Yanomami/Brazil gut microbiome presented unique functional features, such as a higher abundance of gene families involved in regulation/cell signaling, motility/chemotaxis, and virulence, contrasting with the gut microbiomes from the Yanomami/Venezuela and the other groups. Our study revealed biomarkers, and taxonomic and functional features that distinguished the gut microbiome of Yanomami/Brazil and Yanomami/Venezuela individuals, despite their shared lifestyle, culture, and genetic background. These differences may be a reflection of the environmental and seasonal diversity of the niches they explore. Overall, their microbiome profiles are shared with South American and African traditional groups, probably due to their lifestyle. The unique features identified within the Yanomami highlight the bias imposed by underrepresented sampling, and factors such as variations over space and time (seasonality) that impact, mainly, the hunter–gatherers.},

abstract = {The composition of the gut microbiome in industrialized populations differs from those living traditional lifestyles. However, it has been difficult to separate the contributions of human genetic and geographic factors from lifestyle/modernization. Here, we characterize the stool bacterial composition of four Himalayan populations to investigate how the gut community changes in response to shifts in human lifestyles. These groups led seminomadic hunting-gathering lifestyles until transitioning to varying dependence upon farming. The Tharu began farming 250-300 years ago, the Raute and Raji transitioned 30-40 years ago, and the Chepang retain many aspects of a foraging lifestyle. We assess the contributions of dietary and environmental factors on their gut microbiota and find that the gut microbiome composition is significantly associated with lifestyle. The Chepang foragers harbor elevated abundance of taxa associated with foragers around the world. Conversely, the gut microbiomes of populations that have transitioned to farming are more similar to those of Americans, with agricultural dependence and several associated lifestyle and environmental factors correlating with the extent of microbiome divergence from the foraging population. For example, our results show that drinking water source and solid cooking fuel are significantly associated with the gut microbiome. Despite the pronounced differences in gut bacterial composition across populations, we found little differences in alpha diversity across populations. These findings in genetically similar populations living in the same geographical region establish the key role of lifestyle in determining human gut microbiome composition and point to the next challenging steps of isolating dietary effects from other factors that change during modernization.},

abstract = {We assessed the subsistence-related variation of the human gut microbiome at a fine resolution for two of the main dimensions of microbiome variation, age and geography. For this, we investigated the fecal microbiome and metabolome in rural Bassa and urbanized individuals from Nigeria, including infants, and compared data with worldwide populations practicing varying subsistence. Our data highlight specific microbiome traits that are progressively lost with urbanization, such as the dominance of pristine fiber degraders and the low inter-individual variation. For the Bassa, this last feature is the result of their subsistence-related practices favoring microbial dispersal, such as their extensive environmental contact and the usage of untreated waters from the Usuma River. The high degree of microbial dispersal observed in the Bassa meta-community nullifies the differences between infant and adult intestinal ecosystems, suggesting that the infant-type microbiome in Western populations could be the result of microbiome-associated neotenic traits favored by urbanization.},

abstract = {The gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that have fundamental roles in many aspects of human biology, including immune function and metabolism. The reduced diversity of the gut microbiota in Western populations compared to that in populations living traditional lifestyles presents the question of which factors have driven microbiota change during modernization. Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fibre have a crucial involvement in shaping this microbial ecosystem, and are notably reduced in the Western diet (high in fat and simple carbohydrates, low in fibre) compared with a more traditional diet. Here we show that changes in the microbiota of mice consuming a low-MAC diet and harbouring a human microbiota are largely reversible within a single generation. However, over several generations, a low-MAC diet results in a progressive loss of diversity, which is not recoverable after the reintroduction of dietary MACs. To restore the microbiota to its original state requires the administration of missing taxa in combination with dietary MAC consumption. Our data illustrate that taxa driven to low abundance when dietary MACs are scarce are inefficiently transferred to the next generation, and are at increased risk of becoming extinct within an isolated population. As more diseases are linked to the Western microbiota and the microbiota is targeted therapeutically, microbiota reprogramming may need to involve strategies that incorporate dietary MACs as well as taxa not currently present in the Western gut.},

abstract = {The human gut microbiota (GM) has been associated, to date, with various complex functions, essentials for the host health. Among these, it is certainly worth noting the degradation of the so-called microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs), which the GM breaks down through specific enzymes, referred to as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). This degradation constitutes the first step in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), key microbial small molecules having multiple health-promoting effects for the host organism. The decline in MAC dietary intake in urban Western populations forced the shrinkage of CAZyme repertoire in the GM, as shown by the literature comparing the microbiome layout between Western urban citizens and traditional rural populations. Even if this reduction in GM functional complexity has been associated with the onset of the so-called “diseases of civilization,” only few information regarding the CAZyme variation within Western populations has been provided to date, and its connections with diet and health are still unexplored. In this scenario, here we explore the GM-encoded CAZyme repertoire across two Italian adult cohorts, including healthy lean subjects consuming a Mediterranean diet and obese patients affected by type 2 diabetes, consuming a high-fat diet. In order to impute the CAZyme panel, a pipeline consisting of publicly available software – QIIME, FragGeneScan and HMMER – was specifically implemented. Our study highlighted the existence of robust clusters of bacterial species sharing a common MAC degradation profile in the Italian GM, allowing the stratification of the individual GM into different steady states according to the carbohydrate degradation profile, with possible connections with diet and health.},

 BackgroundTreponema species as commensals of the human microbiome have a prevalence and function depending on the studied niche. In the oral cavity, treponemes are ubiquitous while they have been strictly linked to rural and ancestral populations in the gastro-intestinal tract and are undetected in urban populations. In this study, an in silico analysis of 1481 metagenomes, selected based on the previous detection of treponemes in such sample types, was conducted to predict putative bacterial antagonists of treponemes, i.e. bacteria present when treponemes are lacking and vice versa. Predicted antagonists were subsequently tested in-vitro against Treponema denticola CSUR P7640.ResultsMost frequent predicted antagonists included members of the Bifidobacteriaceae family (23.3%) among which Bifidobacterium longum was the most significant (63.3% in T- group, p <0.0000001) as well as members of the Bacteroides (6.7%) and Streptococcus (13.3%) genera. The relative abundance of the aforementioned taxa was also anticorrelated with that of the Treponema genus in the metagenomes analyzed in this study. B. longum CSUR P7400, Bifidobacterium bifidum CSUR P1194, Bifidobacterium breve CSUR P7882, Bacteroides ovatus CSUR P4577, Bacteroides uniformis CSUR P2248 and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron CSUR P7324 were able to inhibit the growth of T. denticola with B. longum being the most efficient.ConclusionsThese results highlight an antagonism between Bifidobacterium species, known probiotics and bio-preservatives, and Treponema spp. This may help to explain the variation of Treponema prevalence in high-income countries and middle- and low-income countries which might linked to the differential consumption of fermented dairy foodstuff and processed food and therefore to the phenomenon of nutrition transition.},

Smits et al. found that the microbiota of these people reflects the seasonal availability of different types of food (see the Perspective by Peddada). Between seasons, striking differences were observed in their gut microbial communities, with some taxa apparently disappearing, only to reappear when the seasons turned. Further comparison of the Hadza microbiota with that of diverse urbanized peoples revealed distinctly different patterns of microbial community composition. Science, this issue p. 802; see also p. 754 The composition of microbes in the guts of the Hadza hunter-gatherers undergoes an annual cyclic reconfiguration. Although humans have cospeciated with their gut-resident microbes, it is difficult to infer features of our ancestral microbiome. Here, we examine the microbiome profile of 350 stool samples collected longitudinally for more than a year from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. The data reveal annual cyclic reconfiguration of the microbiome, in which some taxa become undetectable only to reappear in a subsequent season. Comparison of the Hadza data set with data collected from 18 populations in 16 countries with varying lifestyles reveals that gut community membership corresponds to modernization: Notably, the taxa within the Hadza that are the most seasonally volatile similarly differentiate industrialized and traditional populations. These data indicate that some dynamic lineages of microbes have decreased in prevalence and abundance in modernized populations.},

abstract = {An important public health question is understanding how changes in human environments can drive changes in the gut microbiota that influence risks associated with human health and wellbeing. It is well-documented that the modernization of societies is strongly correlated with intergenerational change in the frequency of nutrition-related chronic diseases in which microbial dysbiosis is implicated. The population of Bali, Indonesia, is well-positioned to study the interconnection between a changing food environment and microbiome patterns in its early stages, because of a recent history of modernization. Here, we characterize the fecal microbiota and diet history of the young adult women in Bali, Indonesia (n = 41) in order to compare microbial patterns in this generation with those of other populations with different histories of a modern food environment (industrialized supply chain). We found strong support for two distinct fecal microbiota community types in our study cohort at similar frequency: a Prevotella -rich (Type-P) and a Bacteroides -rich (Type-B) community ( p  < 0.001, analysis of similarity, Wilcoxon test). Although Type-P individuals had lower alpha diversity ( p  < 0.001, Shannon) and higher incidence of obesity, multivariate analyses with diet data showed that community types significantly influenced associations with BMI. In a multi-country dataset (n = 257), we confirmed that microbial beta diversity across subsistent and industrial populations was significantly associated with Prevotella and Bacteroides abundance ( p  < 0.001, generalized additive model) and that the prevalence of community types differs between societies. The young adult Balinese microbiota was distinctive in having an equal prevalence of two community types. Collectively, our study showed that the incorporation of community types as an explanatory factor into study design or modeling improved the ability to identify microbiome associations with diet and health metrics.},

An imbalance or dysbiosis in these microbial communities can be associated with a wide variety of human diseases (Petersen and Round, 2014; Pham and Lawley, 2014; Zaura et al., 2014). Moreover, when the microbiota of the same body sites is compared between different healthy individuals, specific microbial community features are apparent (Li et al., 2012; Yatsunenko et al., 2012; Oh et al., 2014; Relman, 2015). In addition, specific selective pressures are found at distinct body sites leading to different patterns in microbial community structure and composition (Costello et al., 2009; Consortium, 2012b; Zhou et al., 2013). Because of these natural variations, a comprehensive characterization of the healthy microbiota is critical for predicting alterations related to diseases. This characterization should be based on a broad healthy population over time, geography, and culture (Yatsunenko et al., 2012; Shetty et al., 2013; Leung et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2015). The study of healthy individuals representing different ages, cultural traditions, and ethnic origins will enable to understand how the associated microbiota varies between populations and respond to different lifestyles.

abstract = {In this study, I use microbiome datasets from global soil samples and diverse hosts to learn whether soil microbial taxa are found in host microbiomes, and whether these observations fit the narrative that environmental interaction influences human microbiomes. A major motivation for conducting host-associated microbiome research is to contribute towards understanding how the environment may influence host physiology. The microbial molecular network is considered a key vector by which environmental traits may be transmitted to the host. Research on human evolution seeks evidence that can inform about the living experiences of human ancestors. This objective is substantially enhanced by recent work on ancient biomolecules from preserved microbial tissues, such as dental calculus, faecal sediments and whole coprolites. A challenge yet is to distinguish authentic biomolecules from environmental contaminants deposited contemporaneously, primarily from soil. However, we do not have sound expectations about the soil microbial elements arriving to host-associated microbiomes in a modern context. One assumption in human microbiome research is that proximity to the natural environment should affect biodiversity or impart genetic elements. I present evidence supporting the assumption that environmental soil taxa are found among host-associated gut taxa, which can recapitulate the surrounding host habitat ecotype. Soil taxa found in gut microbiomes relate to a set of universal ‘core’ taxa for all soil ecotypes, demonstrating that widespread host organisms may experience a consistent pattern of external environmental cues, perhaps critical for development. Observed differentiation of soil feature diversity, abundance and composition among human communities, great apes and invertebrate hosts also indicates that lifestyle patterns are inferable from an environmental signal that is retrievable from gut microbiome amplicon data.

abstract = {The gut microbiome provides access to otherwise unavailable metabolic and immune functions, likely affecting mammalian fitness and evolution. To investigate how this microbial ecosystem impacts evolutionary adaptation of humans to particular habitats, we explore the gut microbiome and metabolome of the BaAka rainforest hunter-gatherers from Central Africa. The data demonstrate that the BaAka harbor a colonic ecosystem dominated by Prevotellaceae and other taxa likely related to an increased capacity to metabolize plant structural polysaccharides, phenolics, and lipids. A comparative analysis shows that the BaAka gut microbiome shares similar patterns with that of the Hadza, another hunter-gatherer population from Tanzania. Nevertheless, the BaAka harbor significantly higher bacterial diversity and pathogen load compared to the Hadza, as well as other Western populations. We show that the traits unique to the BaAka microbiome and metabolome likely reflect adaptations to hunter-gatherer lifestyles and particular subsistence patterns. We hypothesize that the observed increase in microbial diversity and potential pathogenicity in the BaAka microbiome has been facilitated by evolutionary adaptations in immunity genes, resulting in a more tolerant immune system. Significance Human ecological adaptation requires changes at the genomic level. However, the gut microbiome, the collection of microbes inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract and their functions, also responds significantly to ecological challenge. To determine how the gut microbiome responds to evolutionary adaptations in the host, we profiled gut bacterial communities of the BaAka, rainforest hunter-gatherers from Central Africa. The gut microbiome of the BaAka shows adaptations to metabolize foods rich in fiber, tannins and fats. Similarly, higher bacterial diversity and abundance of pathogenic bacteria, compared to other hunter-gatherers and western populations, suggest that the BaAka immune system evolved to coexist with increased pathogen threats. Accordingly, these results show how the gut microbiome contributes to human ecological plasticity, impacting host adaptation and evolution.},

Recent studies have shown the dynamic behavior of the gut microbiota in free-living, healthy persons. To date, it is not known whether these dynamics are applicable during prolonged life sharing in a confined and controlled environment.ResultsThe MARS500 project, the longest ground-based space simulation ever, provided us with a unique opportunity to trace the crew microbiota over 520 days of isolated confinement, such as that faced by astronauts in real long-term interplanetary space flights, and after returning to regular life, for a total of 2 years. According to our data, even under the strictly controlled conditions of an enclosed environment, the human gut microbiota is inherently dynamic, capable of shifting between different steady states, typically with rearrangements of autochthonous members. Notwithstanding a strong individuality in the overall gut microbiota trajectory, some key microbial components showed conserved temporal dynamics, with potential implications for the maintenance of a health-promoting, mutualistic microbiota configuration.ConclusionsSharing life in a confined habitat does not affect the resilience of the individual gut microbial ecosystem, even in the long term. However, the temporal dynamics of certain microbiota components should be monitored when programming future mission simulations and real space flights, to prevent breakdowns in the metabolic and immunological homeostasis of the crewmembers.},

When people move from a rural environment to urban areas, and experience improved socio-economic conditions, they are often exposed to a “globalized” Western type diet. Here, we present preliminary observations on the metagenomic scale of microbial changes in small groups of African children belonging to the same ethnicity and living in different environments, compared to children living on the urban area of Florence (Italy). We analyzed dietary habits and, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, gut microbiota profiles from fecal samples of children living in a rural village of Burkina Faso (n = 11), of two groups of children living in different urban settings (Nanoro town, n = 8; Ouagadougou, the capital city, n = 5) and of a group of Italian children (n = 13). We observed that when foods of animal origin, those rich in fat and simple sugars are introduced into a traditional African diet, composed of cereals, legumes and vegetables, the gut microbiota profiles changes. Microbiota of rural children retain a geographically unique bacterial reservoir (Prevotella, Treponema, and Succinivibrio), assigned to ferment fiber and polysaccharides from vegetables. Independently of geography and ethnicity, in children living in urban areas these bacterial genera were progressively outcompeted by bacteria more suited to the metabolism of animal protein, fat and sugar rich foods, similarly to Italian children, as resulted by PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States), a predictive functional profiling of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker gene. Consequently, we observed a progressive reduction of SCFAs measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, in urban populations, especially in Italian children, respect to rural ones. Our results even if in a limited number of individuals point out that dietary habit modifications in the course of urbanization play a role in shaping gut microbiota, and that ancient microorganisms, such as fiber-degrading bacteria, are at risk of being eliminated by the fast paced globalization of foods and by the advent of westernized lifestyle.},

abstract = {The recent characterization of the gut microbiome of traditional rural and foraging societies allowed us to appreciate the essential co-adaptive role of the microbiome in complementing our physiology, opening up significant questions on how the microbiota changes that have occurred in industrialized urban populations may have altered the microbiota-host co-metabolic network, contributing to the growing list of Western diseases. Here, we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to profile the fecal metabolome of the Hadza of Tanzania, one of the world’s few remaining foraging populations, and compared them to the profiles of urban living Italians, as representative of people in the post-industrialized West. Data analysis shows that during the rainy season, when the diet is primarily plant-based, Hadza are characterized by a distinctive enrichment in hexoses, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and acylcarnitines, while deplete in the most common natural amino acids and derivatives. Complementary to the documented unique metagenomic features of their gut microbiome, our findings on the Hadza metabolome lend support to the notion of an alternate microbiome configuration befitting of a nomadic forager lifestyle, which helps maintain metabolic homeostasis through an overall scarcity of inflammatory factors, which are instead highly represented in the Italian metabolome.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe human gut microbiota interacts closely with human diet and physiology. To better understand the mechanisms behind this relationship, gut microbiome research relies on complementing human studies with manipulations of animal models, including non-human primates. However, due to unique aspects of human diet and physiology, it is likely that host-gut microbe interactions operate differently in humans and non-human primates.ResultsHere, we show that the human microbiome reacts differently to a high-protein, high-fat Western diet than that of a model primate, the African green monkey, or vervet (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus). Specifically, humans exhibit increased relative abundance of Firmicutes and reduced relative abundance of Prevotella on a Western diet while vervets show the opposite pattern. Predictive metagenomics demonstrate an increased relative abundance of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism in the microbiome of only humans consuming a Western diet.ConclusionsThese results suggest that the human gut microbiota has unique properties that are a result of changes in human diet and physiology across evolution or that may have contributed to the evolution of human physiology. Therefore, the role of animal models for understanding the relationship between the human gut microbiota and host metabolism must be re-focused.},

abstract = {Studies of the gut microbiome variation among human populations revealed the existence of robust compositional and functional layouts matching the three subsistence strategies that describe a trajectory of changes across our recent evolutionary history: hunting and gathering, rural agriculture, and urban post-industrialized agriculture. In particular, beside the overall reduction of ecosystem diversity, the gut microbiome of Western industrial populations is typically characterized by the loss of Treponema and the acquisition of Bifidobacterium as an abundant inhabitant of the post-weaning gut microbial ecosystem. In order to advance the hypothesis about the possible adaptive nature of this exchange, here we explore specific functional attributes that correspond to the mutually exclusive presence of Treponema and Bifidobacterium using publically available gut metagenomic data from Hadza hunter-gatherers and urban industrial Italians. According to our findings, Bifidobacterium provides the enteric ecosystem with a diverse panel of saccharolytic functions, well suited to the array of gluco- and galacto-based saccharides that abound in the Western diet. On the other hand, the metagenomic functions assigned to Treponema are more predictive of a capacity to incorporate complex polysaccharides, such as those found in unrefined plant foods, which are consistently incorporated in the Hadza diet. Finally, unlike Treponema, the Bifidobacterium metagenome functions include genes that permit the establishment of microbe–host immunological cross-talk, suggesting recent co-evolutionary events between the human immune system and Bifidobacterium that are adaptive in the context of agricultural subsistence and sedentary societies.},

abstract = {Metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome have only recently begun to explore the differences in taxonomic composition between subjects from diverse geographical origins. Here, we compared taxonomy, resistome and functional metabolic properties of publicly available shotgun datasets of human fecal samples collected from different geographical regions (Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania). Such datasets encompassed gut microbiota information corresponding to 13 developed/industrialized societies, as well as two traditional hunter-gatherer, pre-agricultural communities (Tanzanian and Peruvian individuals). Assessment of the retrieved taxonomic profiles allowed the most updated reconstruction of the global core-microbiome as based on currently available data, as well as the identification and targeted genome reconstruction of bacterial taxa that appear to have been lost and/or acquired during urbanization/industrialization. Functional characterization of these metagenomic datasets indicates that the urbanization/industrialization process which occurred in recent human history has shaped the gut microbiota through the acquisition and/or loss of specific gut microbes, thereby potentially impacting on the overall functionality of the gut microbiome.},

When compared to the microbiota composition from other populations around the world, the Hadza microbiota shares bacterial families with other traditional societies that are rare or absent from microbiotas of industrialized nations. We present additional observations from the Hadza microbiota and their lifestyle and environment, including microbes detected on hands, water, and animal sources, how the microbiota varies with sex and age, and the shortterm effects of introducing agricultural products into the diet.

abstract = {BackgroundIn a series of studies of the gut microbiome, “enterotypes” have been used to classify gut microbiome samples that cluster together in ordination analyses. Initially, three distinct enterotypes were described, although later studies reduced this to two clusters, one dominated by Bacteroides or Clostridiales species found more commonly in Western (American and Western European) subjects and the other dominated by Prevotella more often associated with non-Western subjects. The two taxa, Bacteroides and Prevotella, have been presumed to represent consistent underlying microbial communities, but no one has demonstrated the presence of additional microbial taxa across studies that can define these communities.ResultsWe analyzed the combined microbiome data from five previous studies with samples across five continents. We clearly demonstrate that there are no consistent bacterial taxa associated with either Bacteroides- or Prevotella-dominated communities across the studies. By increasing the number and diversity of samples, we found gradients of both Bacteroides and Prevotella and a lack of the distinct clusters in the principal coordinate plots originally proposed in the “enterotypes” hypothesis. The apparent segregation of the samples seen in many ordination plots is due to the differences in the samples’ Prevotella and Bacteroides abundances and does not represent consistent microbial communities within the “enterotypes” and is not associated with other taxa across studies. The projections we see are consistent with a continuum of values created from a simple mixture of Bacteroides and Prevotella; these two biomarkers are significantly correlated to the projection axes. We suggest that previous findings citing Bacteroides- and Prevotella-dominated clusters are the result of an artifact caused by the greater relative abundance of these two taxa over other taxa in the human gut and the sparsity of Prevotella abundant samples.ConclusionsWe believe that the term “enterotypes” is misleading because it implies both an underlying consistency of community taxa and a clear separation of sets of human gut samples, neither of which is supported by the broader data. We propose the use of “biomarker” as a more accurate description of these and other taxa that correlate with diet, lifestyle, and disease state.},

abstract = {Westernization and its accompanying epidemiological transitions are associated with changes in gut microbiota. While the extremes of this lifestyle spectrum have been compared (hunter-gatherers, industrialized countries), populations undergoing such shifts have received little attention. To fill the gap of knowledge about the microbiome evolution following broad lifestyle changes and the emergence of disease-associated dysbiosis, we performed a cross-sectional study in which we characterized the microbiota of 441 Colombian adults through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and determined its relationship with demographic, health-related and dietary parameters. We showed that in the gut microbiota of this cohort thrive taxa proper of both hunter-gatherers (Prevotella, Treponema) and citizens of industrialized countries (Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Barnesiella); the relative abundances of these taxa differed from those in Western and non-Western populations. We also showed that the Colombian gut microbiota is composed of five consortia of co-abundant microorganisms that are differentially associated with lifestyle, obesity and cardiometabolic disease, and highlighted metabolic pathways that might explain associations between microbiota and host health. Our results give insights into the evolution of the gut microbiota, and underscore the importance of this community to human health. Promoting the growth of specific microbial consortia could help ameliorating physiological conditions associated with Western lifestyles.},

abstract = {Background Human gut microbiome profiles have been associated with human health and disease. These profiles have been defined based on microbes’ taxonomy and more recently, on their functionality. Human groups that still maintain traditional modes of subsistence (hunter-gatherers and rural agriculturalists) represent the groups non-impacted by urban-industrialized lifestyles, and therefore study them provide the basis for understanding the human microbiome evolution. The Yanomami is the largest semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer group of the Americas, exploring different niches of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Venezuela. In order to extend the analysis of this unique and diverse group, we focused on the gut microbiome of the Yanomami from Brazil and compared with those from Venezuela, and also with other traditional groups from the Amazon, considering taxonomic and functional profiles. Results A diversity of taxonomic biomarkers were identified to each South American traditional group studied, including the two Yanomami groups, despite their overall similarity in the taxonomic gut microbiome profiles. Broader levels of functional categories poorly discriminated traditional and urban-industrialized groups. Interestingly, a diversity was observed with the stratification of these categories, clearly segregating those groups. The Yanomami/Brazil gut microbiome presented unique functional features, such as a higher abundance of gene families involved in regulation/cell signaling, motility/chemotaxis, and virulence, contrasting with the microbiomes from the Yanomami/Venezuela and other groups. Conclusions Our study revealed biomarkers, taxonomic and functional differences between the gut microbiome of Yanomami/Brazil and Yanomami/Venezuela individuals. This intra-Yanomami group diversity was accessed due to the increase number of individuals and group studied. These differences may reflect their semi-nomadic behavior, as well as, the local and seasonal diversity of the vast rainforest niche they explore, despite their shared cultural and genetic background. Overall, their microbiome profiles are shared with South American and African traditional groups, probably due to their lifestyle. The unique features identified within the Yanomami highlight the bias imposed by underrepresented sampling, and factors such as variations over space and time (seasonality) that impact, mainly, the hunter-gatherers. Therefore, to reach knowledge about human microbiome variations and their implications in human health, it is essential to enlarge data concerning the number of individuals, as well as the groups representing different lifestyles.},
