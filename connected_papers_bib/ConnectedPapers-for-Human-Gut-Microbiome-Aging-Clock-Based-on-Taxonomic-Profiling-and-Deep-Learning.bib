abstract = {Summary The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that both affects and is affected by its host status. Previous metagenomic analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host age. Nonetheless there was no reliable way to tell a host's age based on the gut community composition. Here we developed a method of predicting hosts' age based on microflora taxonomic profiles using a cross-study dataset and deep learning. Our best model has an architecture of a deep neural network that achieves the mean absolute error of 5.91 years when tested on external data. We further advance a procedure for inferring the role of particular microbes during human aging and defining them as potential aging biomarkers. The described intestinal clock represents a unique quantitative model of gut microflora aging and provides a starting point for building host aging and gut community succession into a single narrative.},

abstract = {Aging clocks that accurately predict human age based on various biodata types are among the most important recent advances in biogerontology. Since 2016 multiple deep learning solutions have been created to interpret facial photos, omics data, and clinical blood parameters in the context of aging. Some of them have been patented to be used in commercial settings. However, psychological changes occurring throughout the human lifespan have been overlooked in the field of “deep aging clocks”. In this paper, we present two deep learning predictors trained on social and behavioral data from Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study: (a) PsychoAge, which predicts chronological age, and (b) SubjAge, which describes personal aging rate perception. Using 50 distinct features from the MIDUS dataset these models have achieved a mean absolute error of 6.7 years for chronological age and 7.3 years for subjective age. We also show that both PsychoAge and SubjAge are predictive of all-cause mortality risk, with SubjAge being a more significant risk factor. Both clocks contain actionable features that can be modified using social and behavioral interventions, which enables a variety of aging-related psychology experiment designs. The features used in these clocks are interpretable by human experts and may prove to be useful in shifting personal perception of aging towards a mindset that promotes productive and healthy behaviors.},

The advent of machine learning lead to the development of the many age predictors commonly referred to as the “aging clocks” varying in biological relevance, ease of use, cost, actionability, interpretability, and applications. Here we present and investigate a novel non-invasive class of visual photographic biomarkers of aging. We developed a simple and accurate predictor of chronological age using just the anonymized images of eye corners called the PhotoAgeClock. Deep neural networks were trained on 8414 anonymized high-resolution images of eye corners labeled with the correct chronological age. For people within the age range of 20 to 80 in a specific population, the model was able to achieve a mean absolute error of 2.3 years and 95% Pearson and Spearman correlation.},

Today, a variety of machine learning approaches have been tested for the purpose of predicting human age based on molecular-level features. Among these, deep learning, or neural networks, is an especially promising approach that has been used to construct accurate clocks using blood biochemistry, transcriptomics, and microbiomics data—feats unachieved by other algorithms. In this article, we explore how deep learning performs in a DNA methylation setting and compare it to the current industry standard—the 353 CpG clock published in 2013. The aging clock we are presenting (DeepMAge) is a neural network regressor trained on 4,930 blood DNA methylation profiles from 17 studies. Its absolute median error was 2.77 years in an independent verification set of 1,293 samples from 15 studies. DeepMAge shows biological relevance by assigning a higher predicted age to people with various health-related conditions, such as ovarian cancer, irritable bowel diseases, and multiple sclerosis.},

abstract = {and Generation of Novel Chemistry T productivity of the pharmaceutical industry is on the decline. Failure rates in clinical trials exceed 90% after therapies are tested in model organisms, and the cost to develop a new drug exceeds $2.6 billion. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may help to reverse this trend and accelerate and improve pharmaceutical R&D. While the term AI and the concept of deep learning are not new, recent advances in high-performance computing, the availability of large annotated data sets required for training, and new frameworks for implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) resulted in an unprecedented acceleration of the field. Since 2014, DNNs have surpassed human accuracy in image, voice and text recognition, autonomous driving, and many other tasks. Early presentations to the pharmaceutical industry on the advances in deep learning in 2014 and 2015 resulted in skepticism and were discarded. In 2017, many pharmaceutical companies started partnering with AI startups and academics or started internal R&D programs. From training DNNs on transcriptional response data for predicting the pharmacological properties of small molecules and biomarker development, to the generation of novel chemistry, deep learning techniques rapidly propagated into many areas of biomedical research. The body of knowledge and the range of applications of deep learning and other machine learning techniques has expanded quickly and permeated into many areas of drug discovery. There have been hundreds of publications deposited in peer-reviewed journals and on ArXiv. In June 2017, Molecular Pharmaceutics announced a special issue titled “Deep Learning for Drug Discovery and Biomarker Development” focused on the applications of AI in chemistry and biomedicine (Figure 1). After a call to the most prominent scientists publishing on deep learning in the areas of computational chemistry and biology, 10 research papers were accepted. One of the main opportunities for AI in drug discovery is in drug repurposing using abundant data sets available from highthroughput experiments with gene expression profiles. Specifically, transcriptional response profiles generated by the Broad Institute, such as the Connectivity Map. The connectivity map uses gene expression signatures to connect small molecules, genes, and disease available through the LINCS Project. Donner et al. used the L1000 data set to develop a new method for measuring the compound functional similarity based on gene expression data for drug repurposing. The method identified drugs with shared therapeutic and biological targets even when the compounds were structurally dissimilar, thereby revealing previously unreported functional relationships between compounds. Imaging data is among the most abundant data type available for deep learning researchers, often allowing for rapid validation of results using human visual sensory organs. Many of the tools developed for image recognition and trained and tested on simple pictures are now available for researchers working with more complex imaging data types, including computed tomography. Gao and Qian used the patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model combined with support vector machines to predict multidrug resistant patients with tuberculosis using a data set of 230 patients from the ImageCLEF2017 competition, achieving reasonably high classification rates. Xiang and colleagues presented a multitask deep autoencoder for the prediction of the human cytochrome 450 inhibition, laying the roadmap for reducing the side effects associated with inhibiting the CYP450. Lane et al. compared various machine learning models for predicting hit molecules forMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using a small curated data set of molecules targeting Mtb. Another article by the Ekins group compared various machine learning techniques for predicting the estrogen receptor (ER) binding. In this work, Russo and co-authors compared the AdaBoost, Bernoulli Naiv̈e-Bayes, Random Forest, support vector classification, and deep neural networks using a variety of metrics and a proprietary data set compiled from public sources to predict ER binding. Again, Random Forest outperformed the other algorithms, demonstrating the value of comparing the various algorithms, especially for simple machine learning tasks. One of the many chemistry related machine learning challenges is the selection of the representation of molecular structure to capture as many of the relevant chemical and biological features and come as close to reality as possible. There are many representations of molecular structures, including a variety of molecular fingerprints, string-based representations, molecular graphs, and others. A molecular graph is a popular representation of the molecular structure for machine learning applications and explored by many groups working on medicinal chemistry related tasks. Hop and colleagues explored the performance of geometric deep learning methods in the context of drug discovery, comparing machine learned features against the domain expert engineered features. The CNN graph outperformed the methods trained on expert engineered features on most of the data sets. The popular deep learning techniques involving CNN are often trained on 2D and 3D images. To help facilitate f the many applications of CNNs in chemistry, Kuzminykh presented the wave transform-based representation of the 3D molecular structure. The group demonstrated that the proposed representation leads to the better performance of CNNbased autoencoders than either the voxel-based representation or the previously used Gaussian blur of atoms, and it can be successfully applied to classification tasks, such as MACCS fingerprint prediction. Deep generative models, commonly referred to as AI imagination, enabled many new applications requiring creativity and},

Recent studies demonstrate that similar epigenetic clocks for mice (Mus Musculus) can be slowed by gold standard anti-aging interventions such as calorie restriction and growth hormone receptor knock-outs. Using DNA methylation data from previous publications with data collected in house for a total 1189 samples spanning 193,651 CpG sites, we developed 4 novel epigenetic clocks by choosing different regression models (elastic net- versus ridge regression) and by considering different sets of CpGs (all CpGs vs highly conserved CpGs). We demonstrate that accurate age estimators can be built on the basis of highly conserved CpGs. However, the most accurate clock results from applying elastic net regression to all CpGs. While the anti-aging effect of calorie restriction could be detected with all types of epigenetic clocks, only ridge regression based clocks replicated the finding of slow epigenetic aging effects in dwarf mice. Overall, this study demonstrates that there are trade-offs when it comes to epigenetic clocks in mice. Highly accurate clocks might not be optimal for detecting the beneficial effects of anti-aging interventions.},

abstract = {Aging is a multifactorial process, which affects the human body on every level and results in both biological and psychological changes. Multiple studies have demonstrated that a lower subjective age is associated with better mental and physical health, cognitive functions, well-being and satisfaction with life. In this work we propose a list of non-modifiable and modifiable factors that may possibly be influenced by subjective age and its changes across an individual’s lifespan. These factors can be used for a future development of individual psychological aging clocks, which may be utilized as a sensitive measure for health status and overall life satisfaction. Furthermore, recent progress in artificial intelligence and biomarkers of biological aging have enabled scientists to discover and evaluate the efficacy of potential aging- and disease-modifying drugs and interventions. We propose that biomarkers of psychological age, which are just as important as those for biological age, may likewise be used for these purposes. Indeed, these two types of markers complement one another. We foresee the development of a broad range of parametric and deep psychological and biopsychological aging clocks, which may have implications for drug development and therapeutic interventions, and thus healthcare and other industries.},

In the present study, we measured the q‐value and age coefficient of these proteins in a plasma proteomic dataset derived from 4263 individuals. A bioinformatics enrichment analysis of proteins that significantly trend toward increased expression with age strongly implicated diverse inflammatory processes. A literature search revealed that at least 64 of these 529 proteins are capable of regulating life span in an animal model. Nine of these proteins (AKT2, GDF11, GDF15, GHR, NAMPT, PAPPA, PLAU, PTEN, and SHC1) significantly extend life span when manipulated in mice or fish. By performing machine‐learning modeling in a plasma proteomic dataset derived from 3301 individuals, we discover an ultra‐predictive aging clock comprised of 491 protein entries. The Pearson correlation for this clock was 0.98 in the learning set and 0.96 in the test set while the median absolute error was 1.84 years in the learning set and 2.44 years in the test set. Using this clock, we demonstrate that aerobic‐exercised trained individuals have a younger predicted age than physically sedentary subjects. By testing clocks associated with 1565 different Reactome pathways, we also show that proteins associated with signal transduction or the immune system are especially capable of predicting human age. We additionally generate a multitude of age predictors that reflect different aspects of aging. For example, a clock comprised of proteins that regulate life span in animal models accurately predicts age.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful approach for integrated analysis of the rapidly growing volume of multi-omics data, including many research and clinical tasks such as prediction of disease risk and identification of potential therapeutic targets. However, the potential for AI to facilitate the identification of factors contributing to human exceptional health and life span and their translation into novel interventions for enhancing health and life span has not yet been realized. As researchers on aging acquire large scale data both in human cohorts and model organisms, emerging opportunities exist for the application of AI approaches to untangle the complex physiologic process(es) that modulate health and life span. It is expected that efficient and novel data mining tools that could unravel molecular mechanisms and causal pathways associated with exceptional health and life span could accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics for healthy aging. Keeping this in mind, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) convened an interdisciplinary workshop titled “Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Research on Determinants and Modulation of Health Span and Life Span” in August 2018. The workshop involved experts in the fields of aging, comparative biology, cardiology, cancer, and computational science/AI who brainstormed ideas on how AI can be leveraged for the analyses of large-scale data sets from human epidemiological studies and animal/model organisms to close the current knowledge gaps in processes that drive exceptional life and health span.

In this paper, we develop a transcriptomic deep-learned age predictor. Deep neural networks (DNN) are trained and tested on more than 6 000 blood gene expression samples from 17 datasets. We apply methods based on output derivatives of DNN to rank input genes by their importance in age prediction and reduce the dimensional of the data. We also show that batch effect in transcriptome datasets of healthy humans is indeed significant, but the existing normalization techniques, while removing technical variation quite effectively, also remove age-associated changes.

Obtained results can be considered as an approximation of human biological age. Parameters in training datasets are selected the most broadly: all potentially relevant parameters (926) from the NHANES database are used. Although the networks are trained on the incomplete data, they demonstrated the ability to make reasonable predictions (with R2 > 0.7) based on no more than 100 biochemical indicators. Hence, for practical reasons the full data on each of 926 indicators are not required, although the analysis of the impact of each indicator is useful for theoretical developments.},

Understanding which genes are associated with healthy aging can provide valuable insights into aging mechanisms and possible avenues for therapeutics to prolong healthy life. However, modeling this complex biological process requires an enormous collection of high‐quality data along with cutting‐edge computational methods. Here, we have compiled a large meta‐analysis of gene expression data from RNA‐Seq experiments available from the Sequence Read Archive. We began by reprocessing more than 6000 raw samples—including mapping, filtering, normalization, and batch correction—to generate 3060 high‐quality samples spanning a large age range and multiple different tissues. We then used standard differential expression analyses and machine learning approaches to model and predict aging across the dataset, achieving an R2 value of 0.96 and a root‐mean‐square error of 3.22 years. These models allow us to explore aging across health status, sex, and tissue and provide novel insights into possible aging processes. We also explore how preprocessing parameters affect predictions and highlight the reproducibility limits of these machine learning models. Finally, we develop an online tool for predicting the ages of human transcriptomic samples given raw gene expression counts.

Given ethnic differences in health, diet, lifestyle, behavior, environmental exposures, and even average rate of biological aging, it stands to reason that aging clocks trained on datasets obtained from specific ethnic populations are more likely to account for these potential confounding factors, resulting in an enhanced capacity to predict chronological age and quantify biological age. Here, we present a deep learning-based hematological aging clock modeled using the large combined dataset of Canadian, South Korean, and Eastern European population blood samples that show increased predictive accuracy in individual populations compared to population specific hematologic aging clocks. The performance of models was also evaluated on publicly available samples of the American population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In addition, we explored the association between age predicted by both population specific and combined hematological clocks and all-cause mortality. Overall, this study suggests (a) the population specificity of aging patterns and (b) hematologic clocks predicts all-cause mortality. The proposed models were added to the freely-available Aging.AI system expanding the range of tools for analysis of human aging.},

abstract = {Age-related physiological changes in humans are linearly associated with age. Naturally, linear combinations of physiological measures trained to estimate chronological age have recently emerged as a practical way to quantify aging in the form of biological age. In this work, we used one-week long physical activity records from a 2003–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare three increasingly accurate biological age models: the unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA) score, a multivariate linear regression, and a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We found that the supervised approaches produce better chronological age estimations at the expense of a loss of the association between the aging acceleration and all-cause mortality. Consequently, we turned to the NHANES death register directly and introduced a novel way to train parametric proportional hazards models suitable for out-of-the-box implementation with any modern machine learning software. As a demonstration, we produced a separate deep CNN for mortality risks prediction that outperformed any of the biological age or a simple linear proportional hazards model. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the emerging potential of combined wearable sensors and deep learning technologies for applications involving continuous health risk monitoring and real-time feedback to patients and care providers.},

In this paper, we propose a new generative model that infers drug molecules that could induce a desired change in gene expression. Our model—the Bidirectional Adversarial Autoencoder—explicitly separates cellular processes captured in gene expression changes into two feature sets: those related and unrelated to the drug incubation. The model uses related features to produce a drug hypothesis. We have validated our model on the LINCS L1000 dataset by generating molecular structures in the SMILES format for the desired transcriptional response. In the experiments, we have shown that the proposed model can generate novel molecular structures that could induce a given gene expression change or predict a gene expression difference after incubation of a given molecular structure.

Many of these aging clocks were pioneered by Insilico Medicine and are available for testing online via www.young.ai, www.aging.ai, and other resources. Several of the DACs demonstrate biological relevance and can be used for a variety of applications ranging from aging and disease target identification, identifying the age-related features implicated in diseases, the inference of causal graphs, analyze the population-specificity of the data type and analyze the mechanism of drug response and many others. The generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to synthesize new data of patients of specified ages in large volume providing for novel target identification techniques, as well as for anonymization and patient privacy methods.

The biological aging acceleration is associated with the remaining health- and life-span. Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNN) could be used to reduce the error of chronological age predictors, though often at the expense of the ability to distinguish health conditions. Mortality and morbidity hazards models based on survival follow-up data showed the best performance. Alternatively, logistic regression trained to identify chronic diseases was shown to be a good approximation of hazards models when data on survival follow-up times were unavailable. In all models, the biological aging acceleration was associated with disease burden in persons with diagnosed chronic age-related conditions. For healthy individuals, the same quantity was associated with molecular markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), smoking, current physical, and mental health (including sleeping troubles, feeling tired or little interest in doing things). The biological age thus emerged as a universal biomarker of age, frailty and stress for applications involving large scale studies of the effects of longevity drugs on risks of diseases and quality of life.

abstract = {Background Lung aging is characterized by a number of structural alterations including fibrosis, chronic inflammation and the alteration of inflammatory cell composition. Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) is known to induce similar alterations and may contribute to premature lung aging. Additionally, aging and CS exposure are associated with transcriptional alterations in the lung. The current work aims to explore the interaction between age- and CS- associated transcriptomic perturbations and develop a transcriptomic clock able to predict the biological age and the impact of external factors on lung aging. Results Our investigations revealed a substantial overlap between transcriptomic response to CS exposure and age-related transcriptomic alterations in the murine lung. Of particular interest is the strong upregulation of immunoglobulin genes with increased age and in response to CS exposure, indicating an important implication of B-cells in lung inflammation associated with aging and smoking. Furthermore, we used a machine learning approach based on Lasso regression to build a transcriptomic age model that can accurately predict chronological age in untreated mice and the deviations associated with certain exposures. Interestingly, CS-exposed-mice were predicted to be prematurely aged in contrast to mice exposed to fresh air or to heated tobacco products (HTPs). The accelerated aging rate associated with CS was reversed upon smoking cessation or switching to HTPs. Additionally, our model was able to predict premature aging associated with thoracic irradiation from an independent public dataset. Conclusions Aging and CS exposure share common transcriptional alteration patterns in the murine lung. The massive upregulation of B-cell restricted genes during these processes shed light on the contribution of cell composition and particularly immune cells to the measured transcriptomic signal. Through machine learning approach, we show that gene expression changes can be used to accurately monitor the biological age and the modulations associated with certain exposures. Our findings also suggest that the premature lung aging is reversible upon the reduction of harmful exposures.},

abstract = {For the past several decades, research in understanding the molecular basis of human muscle aging has progressed significantly. However, the development of accessible tissue-specific biomarkers of human muscle aging that may be measured to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions is still a major challenge. Here we present a method for tracking age-related changes of human skeletal muscle. We analyzed publicly available gene expression profiles of young and old tissue from healthy donors. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis were performed to compare signatures of young and old muscle tissue and to preprocess the resulting data for a set of machine learning algorithms. Our study confirms the established mechanisms of human skeletal muscle aging, including dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis, PPAR signaling and neurotransmitter recycling along with IGFR and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Applying several supervised machine learning techniques, including neural networks, we built a panel of tissue-specific biomarkers of aging. Our predictive model achieved 0.91 Pearson correlation with respect to the actual age values of the muscle tissue samples, and a mean absolute error of 6.19 years on the test set. The performance of models was also evaluated on gene expression samples of the skeletal muscles from the Gene expression Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. The best model achieved the accuracy of 0.80 with respect to the actual age bin prediction on the external validation set. Furthermore, we demonstrated that aging biomarkers can be used to identify new molecular targets for tissue-specific anti-aging therapies.},

In this study we demonstrate for the first time that smoking status can be predicted using blood biochemistry and cell count results andthe recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By employing age-prediction models developed using supervised deep learning techniques, we found that smokers exhibited higher aging rates than nonsmokers, regardless of their cholesterol ratios and fasting glucose levels. We further used those models to quantify the acceleration of biological aging due to tobacco use. Female smokers were predicted to be twice as old as their chronological age compared to nonsmokers, whereas male smokers were predicted to be one and a half times as old as their chronological age compared to nonsmokers. Our findings suggest that deep learning analysis of routine blood tests could complement or even replace the current error-prone method of self-reporting of smoking status and could be expanded to assess the effect of other lifestyle and environmental factors on aging.},

abstract = {Aging clocks dissociate biological from chronological age. The estimation of biological age is important for identifying gerontogenes and assessing environmental, nutritional or therapeutic impacts on the aging process. Recently, methylation markers were shown to allow estimation of biological age based on age-dependent somatic epigenetic alterations. However, DNA methylation is absent in some species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and it remains unclear whether and how the epigenetic clocks affect gene expression. Aging clocks based on transcriptomes have suffered from considerable variation in the data and relatively low accuracy. Here, we devised an approach that uses temporal scaling and binarization of C. elegans transcriptomes to define a gene set that predicts biological age with an accuracy that is close to the theoretical limit. Our model accurately predicts the longevity effects of diverse strains, treatments and conditions. The involved genes support a role of specific transcription factors as well as innate immunity and neuronal signaling in the regulation of the aging process. We show that this transcriptome clock can also be applied to human age prediction with high accuracy. This transcriptome aging clock could therefore find wide application in genetic, environmental and therapeutic interventions in the aging process.},

We validated a subset of model predictors in a Finnish cohort including repeat measurements from 2,144 individuals. We investigated the determinants of accelerated aging, including lifestyle and psychological risk factors for premature mortality. The metabolomic age model was well correlated with chronological age (mean r = .86 across independent test sets). Increased metabolomic age acceleration (mAA) was associated after false discovery rate (FDR) correction with overweight/obesity, diabetes, heavy alcohol use and depression. DNA methylation age acceleration measures were uncorrelated with mAA. Increased DNA methylation phenotypic age acceleration (N = 1,110) was associated after FDR correction with heavy alcohol use, hypertension and low income. In conclusion, metabolomics is a promising approach for the assessment of biological age and appears complementary to established epigenetic clocks.},

Previous analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host health and disease status, genotype and diet. Here, we developed a method of predicting biological age of the host based on the microbiological profiles of gut microbiota using a curated dataset of 1,165 healthy individuals (3,663 microbiome samples). Our predictive model, a human microbiome clock, has an architecture of a deep neural network and achieves the accuracy of 3.94 years mean absolute error in cross-validation. The performance of the deep microbiome clock was also evaluated on several additional populations. We further introduce a platform for biological interpretation of individual microbial features used in age models, which relies on permutation feature importance and accumulated local effects. This approach has allowed us to define two lists of 95 intestinal biomarkers of human aging. We further show that this list can be reduced to 39 taxa that convey the most information on their host’s aging. Overall, we show that (a) microbiological profiles can be used to predict human age; and (b) microbial features selected by models are age-related.},

abstract = {In recent years, different machine learning algorithms have been developed for the estimation of Biological Age (BA), defined as the hypothetical underlying age of an organism. BA can be computed based on different circulating and non-circulating biomarkers. In this perspective, identifying biomarkers with a prominent influence on BA and developing reliable models for its estimation is of fundamental importance for monitoring healthy aging, and could provide new tools to screen health status and the risk of clinical events in the general population. Here, we briefly review the different machine learning (ML) approaches used for BA estimation, focusing on those methods with potential application to the Moli-sani study, a prospective population-based cohort study of 24,325 subjects (35–99 years). In particular, we discuss the potential of BA estimation based on blood biomarkers, which likely represents the easiest and most immediate way to compute organismal BA. Similarly, we describe ML methods for the estimation of brain age based on structural neuroimaging features. For each method, we discuss the relation with epidemiological variables (e.g., mortality), genetic and environmental factors, and common age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer disease), to examine the potential as aging biomarker in the general population. Finally, we hypothesize new approaches for BA estimation, both at the single organ and at the whole organism level. Overall, here we trace the road ahead in the Big Data era for our and other prospective general population cohorts, presenting ways to exploit the notable amount of data available nowadays.},

To promote these goals, we performed a systematic review and analysis of human aging and proteomics studies. The systematic review includes 36 different proteomics analyses, each of which identified proteins that significantly changed with age. We discovered 1,128 proteins that had been reported by at least two or more analyses and 32 proteins that had been reported by five or more analyses. Each of these 32 proteins has known connections relevant to aging and age-related disease. GDF15, for example, extends both lifespan and healthspan when overexpressed in mice and is additionally required for the anti-diabetic drug metformin to exert beneficial effects on body weight and energy balance. Bioinformatic enrichment analyses of our 1,128 commonly identified proteins heavily implicated processes relevant to inflammation, the extracellular matrix, and gene regulation. We additionally propose a novel proteomic aging clock comprised of proteins that were reported to change with age in plasma in three or more different studies. Using a large patient cohort comprised of 3,301 subjects (aged 18-76 years), we demonstrate that this clock is able to accurately predict human age.},

abstract = {The applications of modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within the field of aging research offer tremendous opportunities. Aging is an almost universal unifying feature possessed by all living organisms, tissues, and cells. Modern deep learning techniques used to develop age predictors offer new possibilities for formerly incompatible dynamic and static data types. AI biomarkers of aging enable a holistic view of biological processes and allow for novel methods for building causal models—extracting the most important features and identifying biological targets and mechanisms. Recent developments in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) permit the generation of diverse synthetic molecular and patient data, identification of novel biological targets, and generation of novel molecular compounds with desired properties and geroprotectors. These novel techniques can be combined into a unified, seamless end-to-end biomarker development, target identification, drug discovery and real world evidence pipeline that may help accelerate and improve pharmaceutical research and development practices. Modern AI is therefore expected to contribute to the credibility and prominence of longevity biotechnology in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, and to the convergence of countless areas of research.},

abstract = {Modern computational approaches and machine learning techniques accelerate the invention of new drugs. Generative models can discover novel molecular structures within hours, while conventional drug discovery pipelines require months of work. In this article, we propose a new generative architecture, entangled conditional adversarial autoencoder, that generates molecular structures based on various properties, such as activity against a specific protein, solubility, or ease of synthesis. We apply the proposed model to generate a novel inhibitor of Janus kinase 3, implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and vitiligo. The discovered molecule was tested in vitro and showed good activity and selectivity.},

abstract = {Epigenetic clocks reveal a rejuvenation event during embryogenesis followed by aging. The notion that the germ line does not age goes back to the 19th-century ideas of August Weismann. However, being metabolically active, the germ line accumulates damage and other changes over time, i.e., it ages. For new life to begin in the same young state, the germ line must be rejuvenated in the offspring. Here, we developed a multi-tissue epigenetic clock and applied it, together with other aging clocks, to track changes in biological age during mouse and human prenatal development. This analysis revealed a significant decrease in biological age, i.e., rejuvenation, during early stages of embryogenesis, followed by an increase in later stages. We further found that pluripotent stem cells do not age even after extensive passaging and that the examined epigenetic age dynamics is conserved across species. Overall, this study uncovers a natural rejuvenation event during embryogenesis and suggests that the minimal biological age (ground zero) marks the beginning of organismal aging.},

In this study we demonstrate that site-specific analysis of DNA methylation levels by pyrosequencing at only three CG dinucleotides (CpGs) in the genes Prima1, Hsf4, and Kcns1 facilitates precise estimation of chronological age in murine blood samples, too. DBA/2J mice revealed accelerated epigenetic aging as compared to C57BL6 mice, which is in line with their shorter life-expectancy. The three-CpG-predictor provides a simple and cost-effective biomarker to determine biological age in large intervention studies with mice.},

abstract = {There is a critical need for robust, high-throughput assays of biological aging trajectories. Among various approaches, epigenetic aging clocks emerged as reliable molecular trackers of the aging process. However, current methods for epigenetic age profiling are inherently costly and lack throughput. Here, we leverage the scAge framework for accurate prediction of biological age from very few bisulfite sequencing reads in bulk samples, thereby enabling drastic (100-1,000-fold) reduction in sequencing costs per sample. Our approach permits age assessment based on distinct assortments of CpG sites in different samples, without the need for targeted site enrichment or specialized reagents. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method to quantify the age of mouse blood samples across independent cohorts, identify the effect of calorie restriction as an attenuator of the aging process, and discern rejuvenation upon cellular reprogramming. We propose that this framework may be used for epigenetic age prediction in extremely high-throughput applications, enabling robust, large-scale and inexpensive interventions testing and age profiling.},

abstract = {DNA methylation of a defined set of CpG dinucleotides emerged as a critical and precise biomarker of the aging process. Multi-variate machine learning models, known as epigenetic clocks, can exploit quantitative changes in the methylome to predict the age of bulk tissue with remarkable accuracy. However, intrinsic sparsity and digitized methylation in individual cells have so far precluded the assessment of aging in single cell data. Here, we present scAge, a probabilistic approach to determine the epigenetic age of single cells, and validate our results in mice. scAge tissue-specific and multi-cell type single cell clocks correctly recapitulate chronological age of the original tissue, while uncovering the inherent heterogeneity that exists at the single-cell level. The data suggest that while tissues age in a coordinated fashion, some cells age more or less rapidly than others. We show that individual embryonic stem cells exhibit an age close to zero, that certain stem cells in a tissue show a reduced age compared to their chronological age, and that early embryogenesis is associated with the reduction of epigenetic age of individual cells, the latter supporting a natural rejuvenation event during gastrulation. scAge is both robust against the low coverage that is characteristic of single cell sequencing techniques and is flexible for studying any cell type and vertebrate organism of interest. This study demonstrates for the first time the potential for accurate epigenetic age profiling at single-cell resolution.},
