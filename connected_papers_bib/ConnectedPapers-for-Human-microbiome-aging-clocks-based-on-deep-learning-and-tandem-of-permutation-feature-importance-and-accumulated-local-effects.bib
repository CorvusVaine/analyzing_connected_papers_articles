abstract = {Abstract The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that both affects and is affected by its host status. Previous analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host health and disease status, genotype and diet. Here, we developed a method of predicting biological age of the host based on the microbiological profiles of gut microbiota using a curated dataset of 1,165 healthy individuals (3,663 microbiome samples). Our predictive model, a human microbiome clock, has an architecture of a deep neural network and achieves the accuracy of 3.94 years mean absolute error in cross-validation. The performance of the deep microbiome clock was also evaluated on several additional populations. We further introduce a platform for biological interpretation of individual microbial features used in age models, which relies on permutation feature importance and accumulated local effects. This approach has allowed us to define two lists of 95 intestinal biomarkers of human aging. We further show that this list can be reduced to 39 taxa that convey the most information on their host’s aging. Overall, we show that (a) microbiological profiles can be used to predict human age; and (b) microbial features selected by models are age-related.},

abstract = {Aging clocks that accurately predict human age based on various biodata types are among the most important recent advances in biogerontology. Since 2016 multiple deep learning solutions have been created to interpret facial photos, omics data, and clinical blood parameters in the context of aging. Some of them have been patented to be used in commercial settings. However, psychological changes occurring throughout the human lifespan have been overlooked in the field of “deep aging clocks”. In this paper, we present two deep learning predictors trained on social and behavioral data from Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study: (a) PsychoAge, which predicts chronological age, and (b) SubjAge, which describes personal aging rate perception. Using 50 distinct features from the MIDUS dataset these models have achieved a mean absolute error of 6.7 years for chronological age and 7.3 years for subjective age. We also show that both PsychoAge and SubjAge are predictive of all-cause mortality risk, with SubjAge being a more significant risk factor. Both clocks contain actionable features that can be modified using social and behavioral interventions, which enables a variety of aging-related psychology experiment designs. The features used in these clocks are interpretable by human experts and may prove to be useful in shifting personal perception of aging towards a mindset that promotes productive and healthy behaviors.},

abstract = {and Generation of Novel Chemistry T productivity of the pharmaceutical industry is on the decline. Failure rates in clinical trials exceed 90% after therapies are tested in model organisms, and the cost to develop a new drug exceeds $2.6 billion. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may help to reverse this trend and accelerate and improve pharmaceutical R&D. While the term AI and the concept of deep learning are not new, recent advances in high-performance computing, the availability of large annotated data sets required for training, and new frameworks for implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) resulted in an unprecedented acceleration of the field. Since 2014, DNNs have surpassed human accuracy in image, voice and text recognition, autonomous driving, and many other tasks. Early presentations to the pharmaceutical industry on the advances in deep learning in 2014 and 2015 resulted in skepticism and were discarded. In 2017, many pharmaceutical companies started partnering with AI startups and academics or started internal R&D programs. From training DNNs on transcriptional response data for predicting the pharmacological properties of small molecules and biomarker development, to the generation of novel chemistry, deep learning techniques rapidly propagated into many areas of biomedical research. The body of knowledge and the range of applications of deep learning and other machine learning techniques has expanded quickly and permeated into many areas of drug discovery. There have been hundreds of publications deposited in peer-reviewed journals and on ArXiv. In June 2017, Molecular Pharmaceutics announced a special issue titled “Deep Learning for Drug Discovery and Biomarker Development” focused on the applications of AI in chemistry and biomedicine (Figure 1). After a call to the most prominent scientists publishing on deep learning in the areas of computational chemistry and biology, 10 research papers were accepted. One of the main opportunities for AI in drug discovery is in drug repurposing using abundant data sets available from highthroughput experiments with gene expression profiles. Specifically, transcriptional response profiles generated by the Broad Institute, such as the Connectivity Map. The connectivity map uses gene expression signatures to connect small molecules, genes, and disease available through the LINCS Project. Donner et al. used the L1000 data set to develop a new method for measuring the compound functional similarity based on gene expression data for drug repurposing. The method identified drugs with shared therapeutic and biological targets even when the compounds were structurally dissimilar, thereby revealing previously unreported functional relationships between compounds. Imaging data is among the most abundant data type available for deep learning researchers, often allowing for rapid validation of results using human visual sensory organs. Many of the tools developed for image recognition and trained and tested on simple pictures are now available for researchers working with more complex imaging data types, including computed tomography. Gao and Qian used the patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model combined with support vector machines to predict multidrug resistant patients with tuberculosis using a data set of 230 patients from the ImageCLEF2017 competition, achieving reasonably high classification rates. Xiang and colleagues presented a multitask deep autoencoder for the prediction of the human cytochrome 450 inhibition, laying the roadmap for reducing the side effects associated with inhibiting the CYP450. Lane et al. compared various machine learning models for predicting hit molecules forMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using a small curated data set of molecules targeting Mtb. Another article by the Ekins group compared various machine learning techniques for predicting the estrogen receptor (ER) binding. In this work, Russo and co-authors compared the AdaBoost, Bernoulli Naiv̈e-Bayes, Random Forest, support vector classification, and deep neural networks using a variety of metrics and a proprietary data set compiled from public sources to predict ER binding. Again, Random Forest outperformed the other algorithms, demonstrating the value of comparing the various algorithms, especially for simple machine learning tasks. One of the many chemistry related machine learning challenges is the selection of the representation of molecular structure to capture as many of the relevant chemical and biological features and come as close to reality as possible. There are many representations of molecular structures, including a variety of molecular fingerprints, string-based representations, molecular graphs, and others. A molecular graph is a popular representation of the molecular structure for machine learning applications and explored by many groups working on medicinal chemistry related tasks. Hop and colleagues explored the performance of geometric deep learning methods in the context of drug discovery, comparing machine learned features against the domain expert engineered features. The CNN graph outperformed the methods trained on expert engineered features on most of the data sets. The popular deep learning techniques involving CNN are often trained on 2D and 3D images. To help facilitate f the many applications of CNNs in chemistry, Kuzminykh presented the wave transform-based representation of the 3D molecular structure. The group demonstrated that the proposed representation leads to the better performance of CNNbased autoencoders than either the voxel-based representation or the previously used Gaussian blur of atoms, and it can be successfully applied to classification tasks, such as MACCS fingerprint prediction. Deep generative models, commonly referred to as AI imagination, enabled many new applications requiring creativity and},

To date, transcriptomic data is the second most abundant omics data type following genomics. To deconvolute the relationship between transcriptomic changes and aging one needs to conduct an analysis on the comprehensive dataset. At the same time, biological aging clocks constructed for clinical use needs to robustly predict new data without any further retraining. In this paper, we develop a transcriptomic deep-learned age predictor. Deep neural networks (DNN) are trained and tested on more than 6 000 blood gene expression samples from 17 datasets. We apply methods based on output derivatives of DNN to rank input genes by their importance in age prediction and reduce the dimensional of the data. We also show that batch effect in transcriptome datasets of healthy humans is indeed significant, but the existing normalization techniques, while removing technical variation quite effectively, also remove age-associated changes. So robust methods of age prediction are needed.},

Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNN) could be used to reduce the error of chronological age predictors, though often at the expense of the ability to distinguish health conditions. Mortality and morbidity hazards models based on survival follow-up data showed the best performance. Alternatively, logistic regression trained to identify chronic diseases was shown to be a good approximation of hazards models when data on survival follow-up times were unavailable. In all models, the biological aging acceleration was associated with disease burden in persons with diagnosed chronic age-related conditions. For healthy individuals, the same quantity was associated with molecular markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), smoking, current physical, and mental health (including sleeping troubles, feeling tired or little interest in doing things). The biological age thus emerged as a universal biomarker of age, frailty and stress for applications involving large scale studies of the effects of longevity drugs on risks of diseases and quality of life.},

abstract = {Aging is a complex biological process which is a consequence of an unbalance between cellular dynamical equilibriums, environmental constraints and, from a larger perspective, evolutionary constraints. The key characteristic of aging is that it propagates through the body to progressively affect all organ systems. Because of this systemic nature, the study of aging-related diseases and the design of appropriate drugs and treatments have been shown to be challenging. Thanks to recent technological developments, it is now possible to make a more efficient and systematic use of the large amount of biological and patient data which has been generated and accumulated over the years. All these different data types provide insights into the mechanisms of aging from different and complementary perspectives and designing methods to extract as much information as possible from them is of paramount importance. Advanced multimodal deep learning methods are transforming aging research and drug discovery. AI based platforms can be deployed to identify promising targets for aging-related diseases and AI can be used for the generation of novel drug-like compounds with good activity profiles and suitable chemical properties. Those new computational methods have the potential to revolutionize drug discovery in oncology, a field currently facing an increasing pressure to deliver new drugs in a faster and more efficient ways.},

abstract = {Age-related physiological changes in humans are linearly associated with age. Naturally, linear combinations of physiological measures trained to estimate chronological age have recently emerged as a practical way to quantify aging in the form of biological age. In this work, we used one-week long physical activity records from a 2003–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare three increasingly accurate biological age models: the unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA) score, a multivariate linear regression, and a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We found that the supervised approaches produce better chronological age estimations at the expense of a loss of the association between the aging acceleration and all-cause mortality. Consequently, we turned to the NHANES death register directly and introduced a novel way to train parametric proportional hazards models suitable for out-of-the-box implementation with any modern machine learning software. As a demonstration, we produced a separate deep CNN for mortality risks prediction that outperformed any of the biological age or a simple linear proportional hazards model. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the emerging potential of combined wearable sensors and deep learning technologies for applications involving continuous health risk monitoring and real-time feedback to patients and care providers.},

The best performing DNN in the ensemble demonstrated 81.5 % epsilon-accuracy r = 0.90 with R2 = 0.80 and MAE = 6.07 years in predicting chronological age within a 10 year frame, while the entire ensemble achieved 83.5% epsilon-accuracy r = 0.91 with R2 = 0.82 and MAE = 5.55 years. The ensemble also identified the 5 most important markers for predicting human chronological age: albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, urea and erythrocytes. To allow for public testing and evaluate real-life performance of the predictor, we developed an online system available at http://www.aging.ai. The ensemble approach may facilitate integration of multi-modal data linked to chronological age and sex that may lead to simple, minimally invasive, and affordable methods of tracking integrated biomarkers of aging in humans and performing cross-species feature importance analysis.},

abstract = {The applications of modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within the field of aging research offer tremendous opportunities. Aging is an almost universal unifying feature possessed by all living organisms, tissues, and cells. Modern deep learning techniques used to develop age predictors offer new possibilities for formerly incompatible dynamic and static data types. AI biomarkers of aging enable a holistic view of biological processes and allow for novel methods for building causal models-extracting the most important features and identifying biological targets and mechanisms. Recent developments in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) permit the generation of diverse synthetic molecular and patient data, identification of novel biological targets, and generation of novel molecular compounds with desired properties and geroprotectors. These novel techniques can be combined into a unified, seamless end-to-end biomarker development, target identification, drug discovery and real world evidence pipeline that may help accelerate and improve pharmaceutical research and development practices. Modern AI is therefore expected to contribute to the credibility and prominence of longevity biotechnology in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, and to the convergence of countless areas of research.},

abstract = {Aging is a multifactorial process, which affects the human body on every level and results in both biological and psychological changes. Multiple studies have demonstrated that a lower subjective age is associated with better mental and physical health, cognitive functions, well-being and satisfaction with life. In this work we propose a list of non-modifiable and modifiable factors that may possibly be influenced by subjective age and its changes across an individual’s lifespan. These factors can be used for a future development of individual psychological aging clocks, which may be utilized as a sensitive measure for health status and overall life satisfaction. Furthermore, recent progress in artificial intelligence and biomarkers of biological aging have enabled scientists to discover and evaluate the efficacy of potential aging- and disease-modifying drugs and interventions. We propose that biomarkers of psychological age, which are just as important as those for biological age, may likewise be used for these purposes. Indeed, these two types of markers complement one another. We foresee the development of a broad range of parametric and deep psychological and biopsychological aging clocks, which may have implications for drug development and therapeutic interventions, and thus healthcare and other industries.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful approach for integrated analysis of the rapidly growing volume of multi-omics data, including many research and clinical tasks such as prediction of disease risk and identification of potential therapeutic targets. However, the potential for AI to facilitate the identification of factors contributing to human exceptional health and life span and their translation into novel interventions for enhancing health and life span has not yet been realized. As researchers on aging acquire large scale data both in human cohorts and model organisms, emerging opportunities exist for the application of AI approaches to untangle the complex physiologic process(es) that modulate health and life span. It is expected that efficient and novel data mining tools that could unravel molecular mechanisms and causal pathways associated with exceptional health and life span could accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics for healthy aging. Keeping this in mind, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) convened an interdisciplinary workshop titled “Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Research on Determinants and Modulation of Health Span and Life Span” in August 2018. The workshop involved experts in the fields of aging, comparative biology, cardiology, cancer, and computational science/AI who brainstormed ideas on how AI can be leveraged for the analyses of large-scale data sets from human epidemiological studies and animal/model organisms to close the current knowledge gaps in processes that drive exceptional life and health span. This report summarizes the discussions and recommendations from the workshop on future application of AI approaches to advance our understanding of human health and life span.},

In total, 1152 neural networks are trained and tested. The algorithms are trained and tested on incomplete data: missing values in data records are extrapolated by mean or median values for each parameter. I select the best neural networks in terms of validation accuracy (coefficient of determination and mean absolute error). It turns out that the most accurate results are delivered by multilayer networks (6 layers) with recurrent layers. Neural network types are selected by trial and error. The algorithms reached an accuracy of 78% in terms of coefficient of determination and 6.5 in terms of mean absolute error. I also list empirically determined features of neural networks that increase accuracy for the task of chronological age prediction. Obtained results can be considered as an approximation of human biological age. Parameters in training datasets are selected the most broadly: all potentially relevant parameters (926) from the NHANES database are used. Although the networks are trained on the incomplete data, they demonstrated the ability to make reasonable predictions (with R2 > 0.7) based on no more than 100 biochemical indicators. Hence, for practical reasons the full data on each of 926 indicators are not required, although the analysis of the impact of each indicator is useful for theoretical developments.},

January 28th, 2020 Insilico Medicine decided to utilize a part of its generative chemistry pipeline
to design novel drug-like inhibitors of 2019-nCoV and started generation on January 30th. It
utilized three of its previously validated generative chemistry approaches: crystal-derived pocked-

druglike compounds generated using these approaches are being published at

The need to align biological data to innovative machine learning has stimulated developments in both data integration (fusion) and knowledge representation, in the form of heterogeneous, multiplex, and biological networks or graphs. In this chapter we briefly introduce several popular neural network architectures used in deep learning, namely, the fully connected deep neural network, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network, and the autoencoder. Deep learning predictors, classifiers, and generators utilized in modern feature extraction may well assist interpretability and thus imbue AI tools with increased explication, potentially adding insights and advancements in novel chemistry and biology discovery.The capability of learning representations from structures directly without using any predefined structure descriptor is an important feature distinguishing deep learning from other machine learning methods and makes the traditional feature selection and reduction procedures unnecessary. In this chapter we briefly show how these technologies are applied for data integration (fusion) and analysis in drug discovery research covering these areas: (1) application of convolutional neural networks to predict ligand-protein interactions; (2) application of deep learning in compound property and activity prediction; (3) de novo design through deep learning. We also: (1) discuss some aspects of future development of deep learning in drug discovery/chemistry; (2) provide references to published information; (3) provide recently advocated recommendations on using artificial intelligence and deep learning in -omics research and drug discovery.},

Given ethnic differences in health, diet, lifestyle, behavior, environmental exposures, and even average rate of biological aging, it stands to reason that aging clocks trained on datasets obtained from specific ethnic populations are more likely to account for these potential confounding factors, resulting in an enhanced capacity to predict chronological age and quantify biological age. Here, we present a deep learning-based hematological aging clock modeled using the large combined dataset of Canadian, South Korean, and Eastern European population blood samples that show increased predictive accuracy in individual populations compared to population specific hematologic aging clocks. The performance of models was also evaluated on publicly available samples of the American population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In addition, we explored the association between age predicted by both population specific and combined hematological clocks and all-cause mortality. Overall, this study suggests (a) the population specificity of aging patterns and (b) hematologic clocks predicts all-cause mortality. The proposed models were added to the freely-available Aging.AI system expanding the range of tools for analysis of human aging.},

The biological aging acceleration is associated with the remaining health- and life-span. Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNN) could be used to reduce the error of chronological age predictors, though often at the expense of the ability to distinguish health conditions. Mortality and morbidity hazards models based on survival follow-up data showed the best performance. Alternatively, logistic regression trained to identify chronic diseases was shown to be a good approximation of hazards models when data on survival follow-up times were unavailable. In all models, the biological aging acceleration was associated with disease burden in persons with diagnosed chronic age-related conditions. For healthy individuals, the same quantity was associated with molecular markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), smoking, current physical, and mental health (including sleeping troubles, feeling tired or little interest in doing things). The biological age thus emerged as a universal biomarker of age, frailty and stress for applications involving large scale studies of the effects of longevity drugs on risks of diseases and quality of life.

abstract = {Modern machine learning techniques (such as deep learning) offer immense opportunities in the field of human biological aging research. Aging is a complex process, experienced by all living organisms. While traditional machine learning and data mining approaches are still popular in aging research, they typically need feature engineering or feature extraction for robust performance. Explicit feature engineering represents a major challenge, as it requires significant domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning provide a paradigm shift in eliciting meaningful knowledge from complex data without performing explicit feature engineering. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning in biological age estimation. We consider the current data modalities that have been used to study aging and the deep learning architectures that have been applied. We identify four broad classes of measures to quantify the performance of algorithms for biological age estimation and based on these evaluate the current approaches. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on possible future directions in biological aging research using deep learning. This study has significant potentials for improving our understanding of the health status of individuals, for instance, based on their physical activities, blood samples and body shapes. Thus, the results of the study could have implications in different health care settings, from palliative care to public health.},

abstract = {Multiple recent advances in machine learning enabled computer systems to exceed human performance in many tasks including voice, text, and speech recognition and complex strategy games. Aging is a complex multifactorial process driven by and resulting in the many minute changes transpiring at every level of the human organism. Deep learning systems trained on the many measurable features changing in time can generalize and learn the many biological processes on the population and individual levels. The deep age predictors can help advance aging research by establishing causal relationships in non-linear systems. Deep aging clocks can be used for identification of novel therapeutic targets, evaluating the efficacy of the various interventions, data quality control, data economics, prediction of health trajectories, mortality, and many other applications. Here we present the current state of development of the deep aging clocks in the context of the pharmaceutical research and development and clinical applications.},

abstract = {For the past several decades, research in understanding the molecular basis of human muscle aging has progressed significantly. However, the development of accessible tissue-specific biomarkers of human muscle aging that may be measured to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions is still a major challenge. Here we present a method for tracking age-related changes of human skeletal muscle. We analyzed publicly available gene expression profiles of young and old tissue from healthy donors. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis were performed to compare signatures of young and old muscle tissue and to preprocess the resulting data for a set of machine learning algorithms. Our study confirms the established mechanisms of human skeletal muscle aging, including dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis, PPAR signaling and neurotransmitter recycling along with IGFR and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Applying several supervised machine learning techniques, including neural networks, we built a panel of tissue-specific biomarkers of aging. Our predictive model achieved 0.91 Pearson correlation with respect to the actual age values of the muscle tissue samples, and a mean absolute error of 6.19 years on the test set. The performance of models was also evaluated on gene expression samples of the skeletal muscles from the Gene expression Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. The best model achieved the accuracy of 0.80 with respect to the actual age bin prediction on the external validation set. Furthermore, we demonstrated that aging biomarkers can be used to identify new molecular targets for tissue-specific anti-aging therapies.},

abstract = {Introduction:A special place in the development of new drugs is computer modeling of potential drug candidates. At this stage, the molecular structure of a drug is created and virtually validated. Molecular structures are created mostly by bioinformatics specialists and medical chemists. Therefore, the process of creating and virtual testing of molecules is long and expensive.Purpose:Developing a model of a deep generative adversarial neural network and its reinforcement environment for generating targeted small organic molecular structures with predetermined properties, as well as reward functions for molecular diversity.Results: The developed deep neural network model called ATNC is based on the concepts of adversarial learning and reinforcement learning. The model uses a recurrent neural network with external memory as a generator of molecular structures, and a special neural network block for selecting the generated molecules before their real estimation by the environment. A new objective reward function of internal clustering by diversity is proposed, which allows the model to generate more diverse chemistry. Comparative experiments have shown that the proposed ATNC model is better than its closest competitor in terms of generating unique and more complex valid molecular structures. It has also been demonstrated that the the molecules generated by ATNC match to the a priori distributions of the key molecular descriptors of the training molecules. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset of 15 000 drug-like molecular compounds collected manually from the ChemDiv collection.Practical relevance:The proposed model can be used as an intelligent assistant in developing new drugs by medical chemists.},

GENTRL optimizes synthetic feasibility, novelty, and biological activity. We used GENTRL to discover potent inhibitors of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a kinase target implicated in fibrosis and other diseases, in 21 days. Four compounds were active in biochemical assays, and two were validated in cell-based assays. One lead candidate was tested and demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics in mice. A machine learning model allows the identification of new small-molecule kinase inhibitors in days.},

abstract = {The applications of modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within the field of aging research offer tremendous opportunities. Aging is an almost universal unifying feature possessed by all living organisms, tissues, and cells. Modern deep learning techniques used to develop age predictors offer new possibilities for formerly incompatible dynamic and static data types. AI biomarkers of aging enable a holistic view of biological processes and allow for novel methods for building causal models—extracting the most important features and identifying biological targets and mechanisms. Recent developments in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) permit the generation of diverse synthetic molecular and patient data, identification of novel biological targets, and generation of novel molecular compounds with desired properties and geroprotectors. These novel techniques can be combined into a unified, seamless end-to-end biomarker development, target identification, drug discovery and real world evidence pipeline that may help accelerate and improve pharmaceutical research and development practices. Modern AI is therefore expected to contribute to the credibility and prominence of longevity biotechnology in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, and to the convergence of countless areas of research.},
