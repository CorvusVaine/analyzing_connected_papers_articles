abstract = {The human gut microbiome encodes a large variety of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), but the short lengths of AMPs pose a challenge for computational prediction. Here we combined multiple natural language processing neural network models, including LSTM, Attention and BERT, to form a unified pipeline for candidate AMP identification from human gut microbiome data. Of 2,349 sequences identified as candidate AMPs, 216 were chemically synthesized, with 181 showing antimicrobial activity (a positive rate of >83%). Most of these peptides have less than 40% sequence homology to AMPs in the training set. Further characterization of the 11 most potent AMPs showed high efficacy against antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative pathogens and demonstrated significant efficacy in lowering bacterial load by more than tenfold against a mouse model of bacterial lung infection. Our study showcases the potential of machine learning approaches for mining functional peptides from metagenome data and accelerating the discovery of promising AMP candidate molecules for in-depth investigations.},

Here, using age/region-matched sub-sets, we analysed the gut microbiome differences across five major diseases in a multi-cohort dataset constituting more than 2500 individuals from 20 to 89 years old. We show that disease-microbiome associations display specific age-centric trends. Ageing-associated microbiome alterations towards a disease-like configuration occur in colorectal cancer patients, thereby masking disease signatures. We identified a microbiome disease response shared across multiple diseases in elderly subjects that is distinct from that in young/middle-aged individuals, but also a novel set of taxa consistently gained in disease across all age groups. A subset of these taxa was associated with increased frailty in subjects from the ELDERMET cohort. The relevant taxa differentially encode specific functions that are known to have disease associations.},

abstract = {Small-molecule defense Small-peptide defense molecules are produced by most organisms to fend off invasion by bacteria. The antimicrobial peptides that we know about so far show substantial diversity, synergism, and alternative functions. Lazzaro et al. review our knowledge of the evolution and diversity of antimicrobial peptides, the rapid pharmacodynamics of which make them promising candidates for translational applications to complement efforts to overcome antibiotic resistance. Science, this issue p. eaau5480 BACKGROUND Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with potent antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activity. AMPs are ubiquitous among multicellular eukaryotes, with most plant and animal species expressing dozens of distinct AMP genes in epithelial tissues and in response to infection. The diversity and potency of AMPs make them attractive candidates for translational application, and several are already in clinical trials. However, if AMPs are to be used effectively and sustainably, it will be imperative to understand their natural biology and evolution in order to lessen the risk of collateral harm and avoid the resistance crisis currently facing conventional antibiotics. ADVANCES For most of the past 25 years, the prevailing wisdom has been that AMPs are generally nonspecific and functionally redundant—largely interchangeable provided that they were produced quickly enough to a threshold that could contain infection. Support for this model was drawn from molecular evolutionary observations that AMP genes are rapidly duplicated and pseudogenized within and between species, often with little evolution at the level of the primary amino acid sequence. Furthermore, it was believed that the biochemical simplicity of AMPs reflected fundamentally irresistible modes of action, including permeabilization of the cell envelope through the formation of open pores, which was assumed to largely prevent bacterial evolution of resistance. New evidence within the past 5 years, however, has begun to overturn that model. We now know that AMPs can exhibit remarkable levels of specificity and that some of the evolutionary degradation of AMP gene families may be adaptive. We are learning that genetic variability in AMPs, even at the level of single amino acids, can dramatically alter resistance to infection. There are now multiple documentations of convergent evolution of identical amino acid variants between species and of shared allelic diversity between species. It is increasingly clear that AMPs are highly functionally diversified and that they play roles in varied biological processes, including the regulation of symbiotic communities. It is also becoming apparent that bacteria can evolve resistance to AMPs, although the pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of killing of AMPs are much more favorable than those of conventional antibiotics for the prevention of resistance evolution. OUTLOOK AMPs hold considerable promise for translational applications, but developing their potential will require more sophisticated foundational understanding. AMPs function synergistically in vivo, and emerging evidence indicates that their activities in biological contexts may not be fully captured with classical in vitro assays. Further development of mathematical approaches to study synergies will be required, especially for higher-order interactions, in order to rationally develop cocktails that have high efficacy at low concentrations. Synergies between AMPs and conventional antibiotics should be exploited to rescue drugs that are currently lost to resistance. AMPs should be mined from all domains of life: Although more than 3100 naturally occurring AMPs have been described from taxa representing the breadth of life on earth, almost 40% of AMPs under clinical trial are of human origin. This is potentially risky because any evolved resistance to those AMPs may result in collateral resistance to endogenous human immunity. The biochemical properties and pharmacodynamics of AMPs make them far more refractory to resistance evolution than conventional antibiotics, but care should still be taken to deploy them responsibly. Translational use of AMPs in clinical and other applied settings will be greatly enhanced by understanding how specific AMPs function in their natural contexts and how their evolutionary history may predict their future utility. If we combine the insights from the evolutionary diversification of the AMPs, their activity in the context of synergistic cocktails, and our growing understanding of how to limit resistance evolution, we may avoid repeating the mistakes that have resulted in the current crisis of antibiotic resistance. The combined insight from studying AMPs across the tree of life and the adaptive evolution of AMPs will inform their application and the understanding of AMPs in their natural context. In nature, AMPs are highly diverse, with most AMPs (more than 1000) described in Amphibia. They are released as synergistic cocktails in vivo. In vitro studies found that synergies are frequent and that other traits of AMPs result in a low probability of resistance evolution compared with conventional antibiotics. CREDIT: BEE ILLUSTRATION BY MELISSA BROUSSARD/PHYLOPIC/CC Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are essential components of immune defenses of multicellular organisms and are currently in development as anti-infective drugs. AMPs have been classically assumed to have broad-spectrum activity and simple kinetics, but recent evidence suggests an unexpected degree of specificity and a high capacity for synergies. Deeper evaluation of the molecular evolution and population genetics of AMP genes reveals more evidence for adaptive maintenance of polymorphism in AMP genes than has previously been appreciated, as well as adaptive loss of AMP activity. AMPs exhibit pharmacodynamic properties that reduce the evolution of resistance in target microbes, and AMPs may synergize with one another and with conventional antibiotics. Both of these properties make AMPs attractive for translational applications. However, if AMPs are to be used clinically, it is crucial to understand their natural biology in order to lessen the risk of collateral harm and avoid the crisis of resistance now facing conventional antibiotics.},

abstract = {The genome sequences of many species of the human gut microbiome remain unknown, largely owing to challenges in cultivating microorganisms under laboratory conditions. Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.Draft prokaryotic genomes from faecal metagenomes of diverse human populations enrich our understanding of the human gut microbiome by identifying over two thousand new species-level taxa that have numerous disease associations.},

Feature selection was performed against PseAAC and tripeptide composition using the incremental feature selection method. Ten-fold cross-validation results show that PhD7Faster 2.0 succeeds a decent performance with the accuracy of 81.84%, the Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.64 and the area under the ROC curve of 0.90. The permutation test with 1,000 shuffles resulted in p < 0.001. We implemented PhD7Faster 2.0 into a publicly accessible web tool (http://i.uestc.edu.cn/sarotup3/cgi-bin/PhD7Faster.pl) and constructed standalone graphical user interface and command-line versions for different systems. The standalone PhD7Faster 2.0 is able to detect PrTUPs within small datasets as well as large-scale datasets. This makes PhD7Faster 2.0 an enhanced and powerful tool for scanning and reporting faster-growing clones from the Ph.D.-7 phage display library.},

abstract = {In the last two decades many reports have addressed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the search and design of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AI has been represented by machine learning (ML) algorithms that use sequence-based features for the discovery of new peptidic scaffolds with promising biological activity. From AI perspective, evolutionary algorithms have been also applied to the rational generation of peptide libraries aimed at the optimization/design of AMPs. However, the literature has scarcely dedicated to other emerging non-conventional in silico approaches for the search/design of such bioactive peptides. Thus, the first motivation here is to bring up some non-standard peptide features that have been used to build classical ML predictive models. Secondly, it is valuable to highlight emerging ML algorithms and alternative computational tools to predict/design AMPs as well as to explore their chemical space. Another point worthy of mention is the recent application of evolutionary algorithms that actually simulate sequence evolution to both the generation of diversity-oriented peptide libraries and the optimization of hit peptides.

abstract = {Motivation Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have the potential to tackle multidrug-resistant pathogens in both clinical and non-clinical contexts. The recent growth in the availability of genomes and metagenomes provides an opportunity for in silico prediction of novel AMP molecules. However, due to the small size of these peptides, standard gene prospection methods cannot be applied in this domain and alternative approaches are necessary. In particular, standard gene prediction methods have low precision for short peptides, and functional classification by homology results in low recall. Results Here, we present Macrel (for metagenomic AMP classification and retrieval), which is an end-to-end pipeline for the prospection of high-quality AMP candidates from (meta)genomes. For this, we introduce a novel set of 22 peptide features. These were used to build classifiers which perform similarly to the state-of-the-art in the prediction of both antimicrobial and hemolytic activity of peptides, but with enhanced precision (using standard benchmarks as well as a stricter testing regime). We demonstrate that Macrel recovers high-quality AMP candidates using realistic simulations and real data. Availability Macrel is implemented in Python 3. It is available as open source at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/macrel and through bioconda. Classification of peptides or prediction of AMPs in contigs can also be performed on the webserver: http://big-data-biology.org/software/macrel.},

We show that the graph convolutional model outperforms deep neural nets in terms of accuracy (achieving 75% average test-set accuracy), receiver-operator-characteristics (92.1% average AUC), and precision-recall (50% average AUPR). Additionally, the convolutional net’s performance complements that of the random forest, achieving similar accuracy but better receiver-operator-characteristics and lower area under precision-recall. Lastly, we are able to achieve over 90% average top-3 accuracy across all of our models.

abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota affects colorectal cancer development, but previous studies have varied in population, technical methods, and associations with cancer. Understanding these variations is needed for comparisons and for potential pooling across studies. Therefore, we performed whole-genome shotgun sequencing on fecal samples from 52 pre-treatment colorectal cancer cases and 52 matched controls from Washington, DC. We compared findings from a previously published 16S rRNA study to the metagenomics-derived taxonomy within the same population. In addition, metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways in the Washington, DC cases and controls were compared to cases and controls recruited in France whose specimens were processed using the same platform. Associations between the presence of fecal Fusobacteria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas with colorectal cancer detected by 16S rRNA were reproduced by metagenomics, whereas higher relative abundance of Clostridia in cancer cases based on 16S rRNA was merely borderline based on metagenomics. This demonstrated that within the same sample set, most, but not all taxonomic associations were seen with both methods. Considering significant cancer associations with the relative abundance of genes, modules, and pathways in a recently published French metagenomics dataset, statistically significant associations in the Washington, DC population were detected for four out of 10 genes, three out of nine modules, and seven out of 17 pathways. In total, colorectal cancer status in the Washington, DC study was associated with 39% of the metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways identified in the French study. More within and between population comparisons are needed to identify sources of variation and disease associations that can be reproduced despite these variations. Future studies should have larger sample sizes or pool data across studies to have sufficient power to detect associations that are reproducible and significant after correction for multiple testing.},

Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.Multicohort analysis identifies microbial signatures of colorectal cancer in fecal microbiomes.},

abstract = {Summary The acquisition and development of the infant microbiome are key to establishing a healthy host-microbiome symbiosis. The maternal microbial reservoir is thought to play a crucial role in this process. However, the source and transmission routes of the infant pioneering microbes are poorly understood. To address this, we longitudinally sampled the microbiome of 25 mother-infant pairs across multiple body sites from birth up to 4 months postpartum. Strain-level metagenomic profiling showed a rapid influx of microbes at birth followed by strong selection during the first few days of life. Maternal skin and vaginal strains colonize only transiently, and the infant continues to acquire microbes from distinct maternal sources after birth. Maternal gut strains proved more persistent in the infant gut and ecologically better adapted than those acquired from other sources. Together, these data describe the mother-to-infant microbiome transmission routes that are integral in the development of the infant microbiome.},

abstract = {Summary The body-wide human microbiome plays a role in health, but its full diversity remains uncharacterized, particularly outside of the gut and in international populations. We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species, expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.},

abstract = {Objective To evaluate the potential for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from faecal metagenomes. Design We performed metagenome-wide association studies on faecal samples from 74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and validated the results in 16 patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further validated the biomarkers in two published cohorts from France and Austria. Finally, we employed targeted quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate diagnostic potential of selected biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 47 patients and 109 controls. Results Besides confirming known associations of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found significant associations with several species, including Parvimonas micra and Solobacterium moorei. We identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated CRC and control microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the French and Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from controls with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77, respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23. These genes were enriched in early-stage (I–II) patient microbiomes, highlighting the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC. Conclusions We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable clinically relevant technology. Our study thus takes a step further towards affordable non-invasive early diagnostic biomarkers for CRC from faecal samples.},

 Background: With the advent of metagenomics, many large studies have been conducted with the quest of better understanding gut microbiota changes in relation to varying health conditions. Significant findings have been made for diseases such as cirrhosis, colorectal cancers, inflammatory bowel diseases and others, yet one that stands out is obesity for which conflicting results have been reported in the literature. Methods: Here, we built and analyzed a cross-study dataset of healthy and obese individuals looking for major changes in the the taxonomic and functional composition of their metagenomes. Results: Our results suggest that the overweight and normal subjects have no strong dissimilarity in their metagenomes composition. Significant differences were observed when comparing the obese and the non-obese individuals in their functional and taxonomic profiles. Conclusion: In this study, we report the most significant changes that we observed and discuss their potential implication in the obesity condition.},

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.},

abstract = {The composition of the gut microbiome associates with a wide range of human diseases, but the mechanisms underpinning these associations are not well understood. To shift toward a mechanistic understanding, we integrated distinct metagenomic data sets to identify functions encoded in the gut microbiome that associate with multiple diseases, which may be important to human health. Additionally, we identified functions that associate with specific diseases, which may elucidate disease-specific etiologies. We demonstrated that the functions encoded in the microbiome can be used to classify disease status, but the inclusion of additional patient covariates may be necessary to obtain sufficient accuracy. Ultimately, this analysis advances our understanding of the gut microbiome functions that constitute a healthy microbiome and identifies potential targets for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics. ABSTRACT While recent research indicates that human health is affected by the gut microbiome, the functional mechanisms that underlie host-microbiome interactions remain poorly resolved. Metagenomic clinical studies can address this problem by revealing specific microbial functions that stratify healthy and diseased individuals. To improve our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and health, we conducted the first integrative functional analysis of nearly 2,000 publicly available fecal metagenomic samples obtained from eight clinical studies. We identified characteristics of the gut microbiome that associate generally with disease, including functional alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and beta-dispersion. Using regression modeling, we identified specific microbial functions that robustly stratify diseased individuals from healthy controls. Many of these functions overlapped multiple diseases, suggesting a general role in host health, while others were specific to a single disease and may indicate disease-specific etiologies. Our results clarify potential microbiome-mediated mechanisms of disease and reveal features of the microbiome that may be useful for the development of microbiome-based diagnostics.

abstract = {Population genomics of prokaryotes has been studied in depth in only a small number of primarily pathogenic bacteria, as genome sequences of isolates of diverse origin are lacking for most species. Here, we conducted a large‐scale survey of population structure in prevalent human gut microbial species, sampled from their natural environment, with a culture‐independent metagenomic approach. We examined the variation landscape of 71 species in 2,144 human fecal metagenomes and found that in 44 of these, accounting for 72% of the total assigned microbial abundance, single‐nucleotide variation clearly indicates the existence of sub‐populations (here termed subspecies). A single subspecies (per species) usually dominates within each host, as expected from ecological theory. At the global scale, geographic distributions of subspecies differ between phyla, with Firmicutes subspecies being significantly more geographically restricted. To investigate the functional significance of the delineated subspecies, we identified genes that consistently distinguish them in a manner that is independent of reference genomes. We further associated these subspecies‐specific genes with properties of the microbial community and the host. For example, two of the three Eubacterium rectale subspecies consistently harbor an accessory pro‐inflammatory flagellum operon that is associated with lower gut community diversity, higher host BMI, and higher blood fasting insulin levels. Using an additional 676 human oral samples, we further demonstrate the existence of niche specialized subspecies in the different parts of the oral cavity. Taken together, we provide evidence for subspecies in the majority of abundant gut prokaryotes, leading to a better functional and ecological understanding of the human gut microbiome in conjunction with its host.},

abstract = {Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in gut bacteria can hydrolyze conjugated bile salts to unconjugated bile acids and amino acids. Thereby play a crucially important role in host health by reducing serum cholesterol levels, preserving bile acids balance and regulating various metabolism as signaling molecules. Here we present the taxonomic identification of BSHs in human microbiota and elucidate the abundance and activity differences of various bacterial BSHs among 11 different populations. For the first time, we have revealed BSH are distributed in 154 intestinal bacterial strains within 33 genera in human microbiota. However, these BSHs present obviously differentiation for the sequence identity being from 28.6% to 100%, and the 32.7% bacteria strains having more than one paralogs of BSHs with dissimilarity. Therefore, we reclassified the BSHs from the different genera into 6 phylotypes basing on their phylogenetic tree, and demonstrate the significant abundance patterns of BSH phylotypes among different populations. From the enzyme activity comparison, the representative sequence of BSH-T3 was shown highest enzyme activity in 6 phylotypes. Meanwhile, BSH-T3 sequences which all distributed in Lactobacillus show highest abundance in Chinese and Austrian. The information illustrated by this study is useful for investigating the population differences of bile acid metabolism related diseases, and further giving a new suggestion on selection of probiotics or development of pharmaceutical proteins based upon the activity of BSH phylotypes to regulate host metabolism and maintain fitness.},

abstract = {The influence of unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms on human gut health and disease is still largely unexplored. Blastocystis spp. commonly colonize the gut, but its clinical significance and ecological role are currently unsettled. We have developed a high-sensitivity bioinformatic pipeline to detect Blastocystis subtypes (STs) from shotgun metagenomics, and applied it to 12 large data sets, comprising 1689 subjects of different geographic origin, disease status and lifestyle. We confirmed and extended previous observations on the high prevalence the microrganism in the population (14.9%), its non-random and ST-specific distribution, and its ability to cause persistent (asymptomatic) colonization. These findings, along with the higher prevalence observed in non-westernized individuals, the lack of positive association with any of the disease considered, and decreased presence in individuals with dysbiosis associated with colorectal cancer and Crohn’s disease, strongly suggest that Blastocystis is a component of the healthy gut microbiome. Further, we found an inverse association between body mass index and Blastocystis, and strong co-occurrence with archaeal organisms (Methanobrevibacter smithii) and several bacterial species. The association of specific microbial community structures with Blastocystis was confirmed by the high predictability (up to 0.91 area under the curve) of the microorganism colonization based on the species-level composition of the microbiome. Finally, we reconstructed and functionally profiled 43 new draft Blastocystis genomes and discovered a higher intra subtype variability of ST1 and ST2 compared with ST3 and ST4. Altogether, we provide an in-depth epidemiologic, ecological, and genomic analysis of Blastocystis, and show how metagenomics can be crucial to advance population genomics of human parasites.},

abstract = {Machine learning-based classification approaches are widely used to predict host phenotypes from microbiome data. Classifiers are typically employed by considering operational taxonomic units or relative abundance profiles as input features. Such types of data are intrinsically sparse, which opens the opportunity to make predictions from the presence/absence rather than the relative abundance of microbial taxa. This also poses the question whether it is the presence rather than the abundance of particular taxa to be relevant for discrimination purposes, an aspect that has been so far overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by performing a meta-analysis on 4,128 publicly available metagenomes associated with multiple case-control studies. At species-level taxonomic resolution, we show that it is the presence rather than the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa to be important when building classification models. Such findings are robust to the choice of the classifier and confirmed by statistical tests applied to identifying differentially abundant/present taxa. Results are further confirmed at coarser taxonomic resolutions and validated on 4,026 additional 16S rRNA samples coming from 30 public case-control studies.},

abstract = {Objective Fusobacteria are not common nor relatively abundant in non-colorectal cancer (CRC) populations, however, we identified multiple Fusobacterium taxa nearly absent in western and rural populations to be comparatively more prevalent and relatively abundant in southern Chinese populations. We investigated whether these represented known or novel lineages in the Fusobacterium genus, and assessed their genomes for features implicated in development of cancer. Methods Prevalence and relative abundances of fusobacterial species were calculated from 3157 CRC and non-CRC gut metagenomes representing 16 populations from various biogeographies. Microbial genomes were assembled and compared with existing reference genomes to assess novel fusobacterial diversity. Phylogenetic distribution of virulence genes implicated in CRC was investigated. Results Irrespective of CRC disease status, southern Chinese populations harboured increased prevalence (maximum 39% vs 7%) and relative abundances (average 0.4% vs 0.04% of gut community) of multiple recognised and novel fusobacterial taxa phylogenetically distinct from Fusobacterium nucleatum. Genomes assembled from southern Chinese gut metagenomes increased existing fusobacterial diversity by 14.3%. Homologues of the FadA adhesin linked to CRC were consistently detected in several monophyletic lineages sister to and inclusive of F. varium and F. ulcerans, but not F. mortiferum. We also detected increased prevalence and relative abundances of F. varium in CRC compared with non-CRC cohorts, which together with distribution of FadA homologues supports a possible association with gut disease. Conclusion The proportion of fusobacteria in guts of southern Chinese populations are higher compared with several western and rural populations in line with the notion of environment/biogeography driving human gut microbiome composition. Several non-nucleatum taxa possess FadA homologues and were enriched in CRC cohorts; whether this imposes a risk in developing CRC and other gut diseases deserves further investigation.},

Here, we used metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC patients from tumor‐free controls in a study population of 156 participants. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved > 45% relative to the FOBT, while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early‐ and late‐stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control populations (N = 335) from different countries. CRC‐associated changes in the fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal tumor‐related host–microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino acids in CRC patients, accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide metabolism.},

abstract = {Among the human health conditions linked to microbial communities, phenotypes are often associated with only a subset of strains within causal microbial groups. Although it has been critical for decades in microbial physiology to characterize individual strains, this has been challenging when using culture-independent high-throughput metagenomics. We introduce StrainPhlAn, a novel metagenomic strain identification approach, and apply it to characterize the genetic structure of thousands of strains from more than 125 species in more than 1500 gut metagenomes drawn from populations spanning North and South American, European, Asian, and African countries. The method relies on per-sample dominant sequence variant reconstruction within species-specific marker genes. It identified primarily subject-specific strain variants (<5% inter-subject strain sharing), and we determined that a single strain typically dominated each species and was retained over time (for >70% of species). Microbial population structure was correlated in several distinct ways with the geographic structure of the host population. In some cases, discrete subspecies (e.g., for Eubacterium rectale and Prevotella copri) or continuous microbial genetic variations (e.g., for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were associated with geographically distinct human populations, whereas few strains occurred in multiple unrelated cohorts. We further estimated the genetic variability of gut microbes, with Bacteroides species appearing remarkably consistent (0.45% median number of nucleotide variants between strains), whereas P. copri was among the most plastic gut colonizers. We thus characterize here the population genetics of previously inaccessible intestinal microbes, providing a comprehensive strain-level genetic overview of the gut microbial diversity.},

abstract = {The composition of the human gut microbiota is linked to health and disease, but knowledge of individual microbial species is needed to decipher their biological roles. Despite extensive culturing and sequencing efforts, the complete bacterial repertoire of the human gut microbiota remains undefined. Here we identify 1,952 uncultured candidate bacterial species by reconstructing 92,143 metagenome-assembled genomes from 11,850 human gut microbiomes. These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature. Our work expands the known diversity of uncultured gut bacteria, which provides unprecedented resolution for taxonomic and functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota.The known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota is substantially expanded with the discovery of 1,952 uncultured bacterial species that greatly improve classification of understudied African and South American samples.},

abstract = {Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

abstract = {Eubacterium rectale is one of the most prevalent human gut bacteria, but its diversity and population genetics are not well understood because large-scale whole-genome investigations of this microbe have not been carried out. Here, we leverage metagenomic assembly followed by a reference-based binning strategy to screen over 6500 gut metagenomes spanning geography and lifestyle and reconstruct over 1300 E. rectale high-quality genomes from metagenomes. We extend previous results of biogeographic stratification, identifying a new subspecies predominantly found in African individuals and showing that closely related non-human primates do not harbor E. rectale. Comparison of pairwise genetic and geographic distances between subspecies suggests that isolation by distance and co-dispersal with human populations might have contributed to shaping the contemporary population structure of E. rectale. We confirm that a relatively recently diverged E. rectale subspecies specific to Europe consistently lacks motility operons and that it is immotile in vitro, probably due to ancestral genetic loss. The same subspecies exhibits expansion of its carbohydrate metabolism gene repertoire including the acquisition of a genomic island strongly enriched in glycosyltransferase genes involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis. Our study provides new insights into the population structure and ecology of E. rectale and shows that shotgun metagenomes can enable population genomics studies of microbiota members at a resolution and scale previously attainable only by extensive isolate sequencing.},

abstract = {This study provides novel insights on the CRC-associated microbiome of a unique cohort in India, reveals the potential role of a new bacterium in CRC, and identifies cohort-specific biomarkers, which can potentially be used in noninvasive diagnosis of CRC. The study gains additional significance, as India is among the countries with a very low incidence of CRC, and the diet and lifestyle in India have been associated with a distinct gut microbiome in healthy Indians compared to other global populations. Thus, in this study, we hypothesize a unique relationship between CRC and the gut microbiome in an Indian population. ABSTRACT Recently, dysbiosis in the human gut microbiome and shifts in the relative abundances of several bacterial species have been recognized as important factors in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, these studies have been carried out mainly in developed countries where CRC has a high incidence, and it is unclear whether the host-microbiome relationships deduced from these studies can be generalized to the global population. To test if the documented associations between the microbiome and CRC are conserved in a distinct context, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic association studies on fecal samples from 30 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls from two different locations in India, followed by a comparison of CRC data available from other populations. We confirmed the association of Bacteroides and other bacterial taxa with CRC that have been previously reported in other studies. However, the association of CRC with Flavonifractor plautii in Indian patients emerged as a novel finding. The plausible role of F. plautii appears to be linked with the degradation of beneficial anticarcinogenic flavonoids, which was also found to be significantly correlated with the enzymes and modules involved in flavonoid degradation within Indian CRC samples. Thus, we hypothesize that the degradation of beneficial flavonoids might be playing a role in cancer progression within this Indian cohort. We also identified 20 potential microbial taxonomic markers and 33 potential microbial gene markers that discriminate the Indian CRC from healthy microbiomes with high accuracy based on machine learning approaches. IMPORTANCE This study provides novel insights on the CRC-associated microbiome of a unique cohort in India, reveals the potential role of a new bacterium in CRC, and identifies cohort-specific biomarkers, which can potentially be used in noninvasive diagnosis of CRC. The study gains additional significance, as India is among the countries with a very low incidence of CRC, and the diet and lifestyle in India have been associated with a distinct gut microbiome in healthy Indians compared to other global populations. Thus, in this study, we hypothesize a unique relationship between CRC and the gut microbiome in an Indian population.},

Strain-level diversity may contribute to discrepancies in genus and species associations with health and disease. We dissected the gut metagenomes of Italians with varying dietary habits, investigating the presence of distinct Prevotella copri strains. Fiber-rich diets were linked to P. copri types with enhanced potential for carbohydrate catabolism. P. copri strains associated with an omnivore diet had a higher prevalence of the leuB gene-involved in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis-a risk factor for glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes. These P. copri pangenomes were compared to existing cohorts, providing evidence of distinct gene repertoires characterizing different P. copri populations, with drug metabolism and complex carbohydrate degradation significantly associated with Western and non-Western individuals, respectively. Strain-level P. copri diversity in gut microbiomes is affected by diet and should be considered when examining host-microbe associations.},

abstract = {In most cases of sporadic colorectal cancers, tumorigenesis is a multistep process, involving genomic alterations in parallel with morphologic changes. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the human gut microbiome is linked to the development of colorectal cancer. Here we performed fecal metagenomic and metabolomic studies on samples from a large cohort of 616 participants who underwent colonoscopy to assess taxonomic and functional characteristics of gut microbiota and metabolites. Microbiome and metabolome shifts were apparent in cases of multiple polypoid adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, in addition to more advanced lesions. We found two distinct patterns of microbiome elevations. First, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly (P < 0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced stages. Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P < 0.005) increased only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. Metabolome analyses showed that branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine were significantly (P < 0.005) increased in intramucosal carcinomas and bile acids, including deoxycholate, were significantly (P < 0.005) elevated in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. We identified metagenomic and metabolomic markers to discriminate cases of intramucosal carcinoma from the healthy controls. Our large-cohort multi-omics data indicate that shifts in the microbiome and metabolome occur from the very early stages of the development of colorectal cancer, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.Colorectal cancer stages are associated with distinct microbial and metabolomic profiles that could shed light on cancer progression.},

abstract = {Association studies have linked microbiome alterations with many human diseases. However, they have not always reported consistent results, thereby necessitating cross-study comparisons. Here, a meta-analysis of eight geographically and technically diverse fecal shotgun metagenomic studies of colorectal cancer (CRC, n = 768), which was controlled for several confounders, identified a core set of 29 species significantly enriched in CRC metagenomes (false discovery rate (FDR) < 1 × 10−5). CRC signatures derived from single studies maintained their accuracy in other studies. By training on multiple studies, we improved detection accuracy and disease specificity for CRC. Functional analysis of CRC metagenomes revealed enriched protein and mucin catabolism genes and depleted carbohydrate degradation genes. Moreover, we inferred elevated production of secondary bile acids from CRC metagenomes, suggesting a metabolic link between cancer-associated gut microbes and a fat- and meat-rich diet. Through extensive validations, this meta-analysis firmly establishes globally generalizable, predictive taxonomic and functional microbiome CRC signatures as a basis for future diagnostics.Cross-study analysis defines fecal microbial species associated with colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing has greatly improved our ability to profile the composition of environmental and host-associated microbial communities. However, the dependency of most methods on reference genomes, which are currently unavailable for a substantial fraction of microbial species, introduces estimation biases. We present an updated and functionally extended tool based on universal (i.e., reference-independent), phylogenetic marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) enabling the profiling of >7700 microbial species. As more than 30% of them could not previously be quantified at this taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on mOTUs are more accurate compared to other methods. As a new feature, we show that mOTUs, which are based on essential housekeeping genes, are demonstrably well-suited for quantification of basal transcriptional activity of community members. Furthermore, single nucleotide variation profiles estimated using mOTUs reflect those from whole genomes, which allows for comparing microbial strain populations (e.g., across different human body sites).Metagenomic analysis based on universal phylogenetic marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) is a useful strategy, especially for microbial species without reference genomes.

However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000–2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.},
