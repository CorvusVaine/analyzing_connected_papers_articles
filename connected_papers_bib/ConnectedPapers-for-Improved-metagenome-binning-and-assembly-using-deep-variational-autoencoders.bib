abstract = {Despite recent advances in metagenomic binning, reconstruction of microbial species from metagenomics data remains challenging. Here we develop variational autoencoders for metagenomic binning (VAMB), a program that uses deep variational autoencoders to encode sequence coabundance and k -mer distribution information before clustering. We show that a variational autoencoder is able to integrate these two distinct data types without any previous knowledge of the datasets. VAMB outperforms existing state-of-the-art binners, reconstructing 29–98% and 45% more near-complete (NC) genomes on simulated and real data, respectively. Furthermore, VAMB is able to separate closely related strains up to 99.5% average nucleotide identity (ANI), and reconstructed 255 and 91 NC Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei sample-specific genomes as two distinct clusters from a dataset of 1,000 human gut microbiome samples. We use 2,606 NC bins from this dataset to show that species of the human gut microbiome have different geographical distribution patterns. VAMB can be run on standard hardware and is freely available at https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb . Metagenomics data are resolved into their constituent genomes using a new deep learning method.},

abstract = {Background Metagenome sampling bias for geographical location and lifestyle is partially responsible for the incomplete catalog of reference genomes of gut microbial species. Thus, genome assembly from currently under-represented populations may effectively expand the reference gut microbiome and improve taxonomic and functional profiling. Methods We assembled genomes using public whole-metagenomic shotgun sequencing (WMS) data for 110 and 645 fecal samples from India and Japan, respectively. In addition, we assembled genomes from newly generated WMS data for 90 fecal samples collected from Korea. Expecting genome assembly for low-abundance species may require a much deeper sequencing than that usually employed, so we performed ultra-deep WMS (> 30 Gbp or > 100 million read pairs) for the fecal samples from Korea. We consequently assembled 29,082 prokaryotic genomes from 845 fecal metagenomes for the three under-represented Asian countries and combined them with the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) to generate an expanded catalog, the Human Reference Gut Microbiome (HRGM). Results HRGM contains 232,098 non-redundant genomes for 5414 representative prokaryotic species including 780 that are novel, > 103 million unique proteins, and > 274 million single-nucleotide variants. This is an over 10% increase from the UHGG. The new 780 species were enriched for the Bacteroidaceae family, including species associated with high-fiber and seaweed-rich diets. Single-nucleotide variant density was positively associated with the speciation rate of gut commensals. We found that ultra-deep sequencing facilitated the assembly of genomes for low-abundance taxa, and deep sequencing (e.g., > 20 million read pairs) may be needed for the profiling of low-abundance taxa. Importantly, the HRGM significantly improved the taxonomic and functional classification of sequencing reads from fecal samples. Finally, analysis of human self-antigen homologs on the HRGM species genomes suggested that bacterial taxa with high cross-reactivity potential may contribute more to the pathogenesis of gut microbiome-associated diseases than those with low cross-reactivity potential by promoting inflammatory condition. Conclusions By including gut metagenomes from previously under-represented Asian countries, Korea, India, and Japan, we developed a substantially expanded microbiome catalog, HRGM. Information of the microbial genomes and coding genes is publicly available (www.mbiomenet.org/HRGM/). HRGM will facilitate the identification and functional analysis of disease-associated gut microbiota.

abstract = {The genome sequences of many species of the human gut microbiome remain unknown, largely owing to challenges in cultivating microorganisms under laboratory conditions. Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.Draft prokaryotic genomes from faecal metagenomes of diverse human populations enrich our understanding of the human gut microbiome by identifying over two thousand new species-level taxa that have numerous disease associations.},

abstract = {Background Shotgun metagenomics based on untargeted sequencing can explore the taxonomic profile and the function of unknown microorganisms in samples, and complement the shortage of amplicon sequencing. Binning assembled sequences into individual groups, which represent microbial genomes, is the key step and a major challenge in metagenomic research. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods have been employed in binning. Genome binning belonging to unsupervised method clusters contigs into individual genome bins by machine learning methods without the assistance of any reference databases. So far a lot of genome binning tools have emerged. Evaluating these genome tools is of great significance to microbiological research. In this study, we evaluate 15 genome binning tools containing 12 original binning tools and 3 refining binning tools by comparing the performance of these tools on chicken gut metagenomic datasets and the first CAMI challenge datasets. Results For chicken gut metagenomic datasets, original genome binner MetaBat, Groopm2 and Autometa performed better than other original binner, and MetaWrap combined the binning results of them generated the most high-quality genome bins. For CAMI datasets, Groopm2 achieved the highest purity (> 0.9) with good completeness (> 0.8), and reconstructed the most high-quality genome bins among original genome binners. Compared with Groopm2, MetaBat2 had similar performance with higher completeness and lower purity. Genome refining binners DASTool predicated the most high-quality genome bins among all genomes binners. Most genome binner performed well for unique strains. Nonetheless, reconstructing common strains still is a substantial challenge for all genome binner. Conclusions In conclusion, we tested a set of currently available, state-of-the-art metagenomics hybrid binning tools and provided a guide for selecting tools for metagenomic binning by comparing range of purity, completeness, adjusted rand index, and the number of high-quality reconstructed bins. Furthermore, available information for future binning strategy were concluded.},

abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomics investigates the DNA sequences directly recovered from environmental samples. It often starts with reads assembly, which leads to contigs rather than more complete genomes. Therefore, contig binning methods are subsequently used to bin contigs into genome bins. While some clustering‐based binning methods have been developed, they generally suffer from problems related to stability and robustness. Results: We introduce BMC3C, an ensemble clustering‐based method, to accurately and robustly bin contigs by making use of DNA sequence Composition, Coverage across multiple samples and Codon usage. BMC3C begins by searching the proper number of clusters and repeatedly applying the k‐means clustering with different initializations to cluster contigs. Next, a weight graph with each node representing a contig is derived from these clusters. If two contigs are frequently grouped into the same cluster, the weight between them is high, and otherwise low. BMC3C finally employs a graph partitioning technique to partition the weight graph into subgraphs, each corresponding to a genome bin. We conduct experiments on both simulated and real‐world datasets to evaluate BMC3C, and compare it with the state‐of‐the‐art binning tools. We show that BMC3C has an improved performance compared to these tools. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the codon usage features and ensemble clustering are used in metagenomic contig binning.

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Metagenomic contig binning is an important computational problem in metagenomic research, which aims to cluster contigs from the same genome into the same group. Unlike classical clustering problem, contig binning can utilize known relationships among some of the contigs or the taxonomic identity of some contigs. However, the current state-of-the-art contig binning methods do not make full use of the additional biological information except the coverage and sequence composition of the contigs.


RESULTS
We developed a novel contig binning method, SolidBin (Semi-supervised Spectral Normalized Cut for Binning), based on semi-supervised spectral clustering. Using sequence feature similarity and/or additional biological information, such as the reliable taxonomy assignments of some contigs, SolidBin constructs two types of prior information: must-link and cannot-link constraints. Must-link constraints mean that the pair of contigs should be clustered into the same group, while cannot-link constraints mean that the pair of contigs should be clustered in different groups. These constraints are then integrated into a classical spectral clustering approach, normalized cut (NCut), for improved contig binning. The performance of SolidBin is compared with five state-of-the-art genome binners, CONCOCT, COCACOLA, MaxBin, MetaBAT and BMC3C on five next-generation sequencing (NGS) benchmark datasets including simulated multi- and single-sample datasets and real multi-sample datasets. The experimental results show that, SolidBin has achieved the best performance in terms of F-score, ARI and NMI, especially while using the real datasets and the single sample dataset.

Second, overlapping sequences are assembled to create longer contiguous fragments. Third, these fragments are clustered based on sequence composition and abundance. Fourth, these sequence clusters, or bins, undergo rounds of quality assessment and refinement to yield MAGs. The optional fifth stage is dereplication of MAGs to select representatives. Next, each MAG is taxonomically classified. The optional seventh stage is assessing the fraction of diversity that has been recovered. The output of this protocol is draft genomes, which can provide invaluable clues about uncultured organisms.

A key objective of metagenomic studies is to analyse organism-specific metabolic pathways and reconstruct community interaction networks. This requires accurate assignment of assembled genome fragments to genomes.

Furthermore, the performance of existing algorithms varies between samples and biotopes. Here, we present a dereplication, aggregation and scoring strategy, DAS Tool, that combines the strengths of a flexible set of established binning algorithms. DAS Tool applied to a constructed community generated more accurate bins than any automated method. Indeed, when applied to environmental and host-associated samples of different complexity, DAS Tool recovered substantially more near-complete genomes, including previously unreported lineages, than any single binning method alone. The ability to reconstruct many near-complete genomes from metagenomics data will greatly advance genome-centric analyses of ecosystems.Here the authors present a tool that enables a flexible set of existing binning algorithms to be combined, resulting in improved binning accuracy and the recovery of more near-complete genomes from metagenomes compared to standalone methods.},

abstract = {Genome-resolved metagenomics has led to the discovery of previously untapped biodiversity within the microbial world. As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. ABSTRACT Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) represent individual genomes recovered from metagenomic data. MAGs are extremely useful to analyze uncultured microbial genomic diversity, as well as to characterize associated functional and metabolic potential in natural environments. Recent computational developments have considerably improved MAG reconstruction but also emphasized several limitations, such as the nonbinning of sequence regions with repetitions or distinct nucleotidic composition. Different assembly and binning strategies are often used; however, it still remains unclear which assembly strategy, in combination with which binning approach, offers the best performance for MAG recovery. Several workflows have been proposed in order to reconstruct MAGs, but users are usually limited to single-metagenome assembly or need to manually define sets of metagenomes to coassemble prior to genome binning. Here, we present MAGNETO, an automated workflow dedicated to MAG reconstruction, which includes a fully-automated coassembly step informed by optimal clustering of metagenomic distances, and implements complementary genome binning strategies, for improving MAG recovery. MAGNETO is implemented as a Snakemake workflow and is available at: https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bird_pipeline_registry/magneto. IMPORTANCE Genome-resolved metagenomics has led to the discovery of previously untapped biodiversity within the microbial world. As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. In this study, we compared commonly used assembly and binning strategies and assessed their performance using both simulated and real metagenomic data sets. We propose a novel approach to automate coassembly, avoiding the requirement for a priori knowledge to combine metagenomic information. The comparison against a previous coassembly approach demonstrates a strong impact of this step on genome binning results, but also the benefits of informing coassembly for improving the quality of recovered genomes. MAGNETO integrates complementary assembly-binning strategies to optimize genome reconstruction and provides a complete reads-to-genomes workflow for the growing microbiome research community.},

abstract = {We previously reported on MetaBAT, an automated metagenome binning software tool to reconstruct single genomes from microbial communities for subsequent analyses of uncultivated microbial species. MetaBAT has become one of the most popular binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity. If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering optimization to increase both computational and memory efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We therefore recommend the community adopts MetaBAT 2 for their metagenome binning experiments. MetaBAT 2 is open source software and available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat.},

ABSTRACT Giant viruses have large genomes, often within the size range of cellular organisms. This distinguishes them from most other viruses and demands additional effort for the successful recovery of their genomes from environmental sequence data. Here, we tested the performance of genome-resolved metagenomics on a recently isolated giant virus, Fadolivirus, by spiking it into an environmental sample from which two other giant viruses were isolated. At high spike-in levels, metagenome assembly and binning led to the successful genomic recovery of Fadolivirus from the sample. A complementary survey of the major capsid protein indicated the presence of other giant viruses in the sample matrix but did not detect the two isolated from this sample. Our results indicate that genome-resolved metagenomics is a valid approach for the recovery of near-complete giant virus genomes given that sufficient clonal particles are present. However, our data also underline that a vast majority of giant viruses remain currently undetected, even in an era of terabase-scale metagenomics.

abstract = {Abstract The human gut microbiota performs functions that are essential for the maintenance of the host physiology. However, characterizing the functioning of microbial communities in relation to the host remains challenging in reference-based metagenomic analyses. Indeed, as taxonomic and functional analyses are performed independently, the link between genes and species remains unclear. Although a first set of species-level bins was built by clustering co-abundant genes, no reference bin set is established on the most used gut microbiota catalog, the Integrated Gene Catalog (IGC). With the aim to identify the best suitable method to group the IGC genes, we benchmarked nine taxonomy-independent binners implementing abundance-based, hybrid and integrative approaches. To this purpose, we designed a simulated non-redundant gene catalog (SGC) and computed adapted assessment metrics. Overall, the best trade-off between the main metrics is reached by an integrative binner. For each approach, we then compared the results of the best-performing binner with our expected community structures and applied the method to the IGC. The three approaches are distinguished by specific advantages, and by inherent or scalability limitations. Hybrid and integrative binners show promising and potentially complementary results but require improvements to be used on the IGC to recover human gut microbial species.},

abstract = {The gut microbiome is associated with human diseases and interacts with dietary components and drugs. In vivo mouse models may be effective for studying diet and drug effects on the gut microbiome. We constructed a mouse reference gut microbiome (MRGM, https://www.mbiomenet.org/MRGM/) that includes newly-assembled genomes from 878 metagenomes. Leveraging samples with ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing (>130 million read pairs), we demonstrated quality improvement in assembled genomes for mouse gut microbes as sequencing depth increased. MRGM provides a catalog of 46,267 non-redundant genomes with ≥70% completeness and ≤5% contamination comprising 1,689 representative bacterial species and 15.2 million non-redundant proteins. Importantly, MRGM significantly improved the taxonomic classification rate of sequencing reads from mouse fecal samples compared to previous databases. Using MRGM, we determined that reliable low-abundance taxa profiles of the mouse gut microbiome require sequencing >10 million reads. Despite the high overall functional similarity of the mouse and human gut microbiomes, only ~10% of MRGM species are shared with the human gut microbiome. Although ~80% of MRGM genera are present in the human gut microbiome, ~70% of the shared genera have <40% of core gene content for the respective genus with human counterparts. These suggest that although metabolic processes of the human gut microbiome largely occur in the mouse gut microbiome, functional translations between them according to genus-level taxonomic commonality require caution. Key Points MRGM provides 46,267 genomes comprising 1,689 bacterial species of mouse gut microbiome. Despite high overlap of genera, functional discrepancy between mouse and human gut microbiota is large. Lineage-specific markers underestimate the completeness of assembled genomes for uncharacterized taxa.},

In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for contig binning only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species). In this paper, we introduce GraphBin2 which refines the binning results obtained from existing tools and, more importantly, is able to assign contigs to multiple bins. GraphBin2 uses the connectivity and coverage information from assembly graphs to adjust existing binning results on contigs and to infer contigs shared by multiple species.

abstract = {MOTIVATION
The field of metagenomics has provided valuable insights into the structure, diversity and ecology within microbial communities. One key step in metagenomics analysis is to assemble reads into longer contigs which are then binned into groups of contigs that belong to different species present in the metagenomic sample. Binning of contigs plays an important role in metagenomics and most available binning algorithms bin contigs using genomic features such as oligonucleotide/k-mer composition and contig coverage. As metagenomic contigs are derived from the assembly process, they are output from the underlying assembly graph which contains valuable connectivity information between contigs that can be used for binning.


RESULTS
We propose GraphBin, a new binning method that makes use of the assembly graph and applies a label propagation algorithm to refine the binning result of existing tools.We show that GraphBin can make use of the assembly graphs constructed from both the de Bruijn graph and the overlap-layout-consensus approach. Moreover, we demonstrate improved experimental results from GraphBin in terms of identifying mis-binned contigs and binning of contigs discarded by existing binning tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the information from the assembly graph has been used in a tool for the binning of metagenomic contigs.

abstract = {Background: The study of microbiomes using whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial populations that may have important roles in their environments. Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools for their evaluation and visualization. Results: To address these challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give investigators control over the analysis, while still being easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP’s hybrid bin extraction algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real datasets. Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance estimation, functional annotation, and visualization. Conclusions: MetaWRAP is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant improvements to the extraction and interpretation of high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.

abstract = {The reconstruction of microbial genomes from large metagenomic datasets is a critical procedure for finding uncultivated microbial populations and defining their microbial functional roles. To achieve that, we need to perform metagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes. Despite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important property of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the metagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep Contrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can efficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and robust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add simulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to produce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the distorted data. Consequently, the trained model will be robust to noise and handle it implicitly during usage. CLMB outperforms the previous state-of-the-art binning methods significantly, recovering the most near-complete genomes on almost all the benchmarking datasets (up to 17% more reconstructed genomes compared to the second-best method). It also improves the performance of bin refinement, reconstructing 8-22 more high-quality genomes and 15-32 more middle-quality genomes than the second-best result. Impressively, in addition to being compatible with the binning refiner, single CLMB even recovers on average 15 more HQ genomes than the refiner of VAMB and Maxbin on the benchmarking datasets. On a real mother-infant microbiome dataset with 110 samples, CLMB is scalable and practical to recover 365 high-quality and middle-quality genomes (including 21 new ones), providing insights into the microbiome transmission.

The recovery of genomes from metagenomic datasets is a critical step to defining the functional roles of the underlying uncultivated populations. We previously developed MaxBin, an automated binning approach for high-throughput recovery of microbial genomes from metagenomes. Here we present an expanded binning algorithm, MaxBin 2.0, which recovers genomes from co-assembly of a collection of metagenomic datasets. Tests on simulated datasets revealed that MaxBin 2.0 is highly accurate in recovering individual genomes, and the application of MaxBin 2.0 to several metagenomes from environmental samples demonstrated that it could achieve two complementary goals: recovering more bacterial genomes compared to binning a single sample as well as comparing the microbial community composition between different sampling environments.

We present an updated and functionally extended tool based on universal (i.e., reference-independent), phylogenetic marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) enabling the profiling of >7700 microbial species. As more than 30% of them could not previously be quantified at this taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on mOTUs are more accurate compared to other methods. As a new feature, we show that mOTUs, which are based on essential housekeeping genes, are demonstrably well-suited for quantification of basal transcriptional activity of community members. Furthermore, single nucleotide variation profiles estimated using mOTUs reflect those from whole genomes, which allows for comparing microbial strain populations (e.g., across different human body sites).Metagenomic analysis based on universal phylogenetic marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) is a useful strategy, especially for microbial species without reference genomes. Here, the authors develop mOTUs2, an updated and functionally extended profiling tool for microbial abundance, activity and population profiling.},

abstract = {Comprehensive, high-quality reference genomes are required for functional characterization and taxonomic assignment of the human gut microbiota. We present the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection, comprising 204,938 nonredundant genomes from 4,644 gut prokaryotes. These genomes encode >170 million protein sequences, which we collated in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalog. The UHGP more than doubles the number of gut proteins in comparison to those present in the Integrated Gene Catalog. More than 70% of the UHGG species lack cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP lack functional annotations. Intraspecies genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which are specific to individual human populations. The UHGG and UHGP collections will enable studies linking genotypes to phenotypes in the human gut microbiome. More than 200,000 gut prokaryotic reference genomes and the proteins they encode are collated, providing comprehensive resources for microbiome researchers.},

abstract = {Summary The body-wide human microbiome plays a role in health, but its full diversity remains uncharacterized, particularly outside of the gut and in international populations. We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species, expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.},

abstract = {Abstract Microbial species play important roles in different environments and the production of high-quality genomes from metagenome data sets represents a major obstacle to understanding their ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Metagenome-Assembled Genomes Orchestra (MAGO) is a computational framework that integrates and simplifies metagenome assembly, binning, bin improvement, bin quality (completeness and contamination), bin annotation, and evolutionary placement of bins via detailed maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on multiple marker genes using different amino acid substitution models, next to average nucleotide identity analysis of genomes for delineation of species boundaries and operational taxonomic units. MAGO offers streamlined execution of the entire metagenomics pipeline, error checking, computational resource distribution and compatibility of data formats, governed by user-tailored pipeline processing. MAGO is an open-source-software package released in three different ways, as a singularity image and a Docker container for HPC purposes as well as for running MAGO on a commodity hardware, and a virtual machine for gaining a full access to MAGO underlying structure and source code. MAGO is open to suggestions for extensions and is amenable for use in both research and teaching of genomics and molecular evolution of genomes assembled from small single-cell projects or large-scale and complex environmental metagenomes.},

abstract = {Abstract De novo metagenome assembly is effective in assembling multiple draft genomes, including those of uncultured organisms. However, heterogeneity in the metagenome hinders assembly and introduces interspecies misassembly deleterious for downstream analysis. For this purpose, we developed a hybrid metagenome assembler, MetaPlatanus. First, as a characteristic function, it assembles the basic contigs from accurate short reads and then iteratively utilizes long-range sequence links, species-specific sequence compositions, and coverage depth. The binning information was also used to improve contiguity. Benchmarking using mock datasets consisting of known bacteria with long reads or mate pairs revealed the high contiguity MetaPlatanus with a few interspecies misassemblies. For published human gut data with nanopore reads from potable sequencers, MetaPlatanus assembled many biologically important elements, such as coding genes, gene clusters, viral sequences, and over-half bacterial genomes. In the benchmark with published human saliva data with high-throughput nanopore reads, the superiority of MetaPlatanus was considerably more evident. We found that some high-abundance bacterial genomes were assembled only by MetaPlatanus as near-complete. Furthermore, MetaPlatanus can circumvent the limitations of highly fragmented assemblies and frequent interspecies misassembles obtained by the other tools. Overall, the study demonstrates that MetaPlatanus could be an effective approach for exploring large-scale structures in metagenomes.},

abstract = {Background Clustering the metagenomic contigs into potential genomes is a key step to investigate the functional roles of microbial populations. Existing algorithms have achieved considerable success with simulated or real sequencing datasets. However, accurately classifying contigs from complex metagenomes is still a challenge. Results We introduced a novel clustering algorithm, MetaDecoder, which can classify metagenomic contigs based on the frequencies of k -mers and coverages. MetaDecoder was built as a two-layer model with the first layer being a GPU-based modified Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM), which controls the weight of each DPGMM cluster to avoid over-segmentation by dynamically dissolving contigs in small clusters and reassigning them to the remaining clusters. The second layer comprises a semi-supervised k -mer frequency probabilistic model and a modified Gaussian mixture model for modeling the coverage based on single copy marker genes. Benchmarks on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that MetaDecoder can be served as a promising approach for effectively clustering metagenomic contigs. Conclusions In conclusion, we developed the GPU-based MetaDecoder for effectively clustering metagenomic contigs and reconstructing microbial communities from microbial data. Applying MetaDecoder on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that it could generate more complete clusters with lower contamination. Using MetaDecoder, we identified novel high-quality genomes and expanded the existing catalog of bacterial genomes. Video Abstract},

Here, we sequence 23 Danish full-scale wastewater treatment plant metagenomes, producing >1 Tbp of long-read and >0.9 Tbp of short-read data.

abstract = {Background Obtaining high-quality (HQ) reference genomes from microbial communities is crucial for understanding the phylogeny and function of uncultured microbes in complex microbial ecosystems. Despite improvements in bioinformatic approaches to generate curated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), existing metagenome binners obtain population consensus genomes but they are nowhere comparable to genomes sequenced from isolates in terms of strain level resolution. Here, we present a framework for the integration of single-cell genomics and metagenomics, referred to as single-cell (sc) metagenomics, to reconstruct strain-resolved genomes from microbial communities at once. Results Our sc-metagenomics integration framework, termed SMAGLinker, uses single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) generated using microfluidic technology as binning guides and integrates them with metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to recover improved draft genomes. We compared sc-metagenomics with the metagenomics-alone approach using conventional metagenome binners. The sc-metagenomics approach showed precise contig binning and higher recovery rates (>97%) of rRNA and plasmids than conventional metagenomics in genome reconstruction from the cell mock community. In human microbiota samples, sc-metagenomics recovered the largest number of genomes with a total of 103 gut microbial genomes (21 HQ, with 65 showing >90% completeness) and 45 skin microbial genomes (10 HQ, with 40 showing >90% completeness), respectively. Conventional metagenomics recovered one Staphylococcus hominis genome, whereas sc-metagenomics recovered two S. hominis genomes from identical skin microbiota sample. Single-cell sequencing revealed that these S. hominis genomes were derived from two distinct strains harboring specifically different plasmids. We found that all conventional S. hominis MAGs had a substantial lack or excess of genome sequences and contamination from other Staphylococcus species ( S. epidermidis). Conclusions SMAGLinker enabled us to obtain strain-resolved genomes in the mock community and human microbiota samples by assigning metagenomic sequences correctly and covering both highly conserved genes such as rRNA genes and unique extrachromosomal elements, including plasmids. SMAGLinker will provide HQ genomes that are difficult to obtain using metagenomics alone and will facilitate the understanding of microbial ecosystems by elucidating detailed metabolic pathways and horizontal gene transfer networks.
