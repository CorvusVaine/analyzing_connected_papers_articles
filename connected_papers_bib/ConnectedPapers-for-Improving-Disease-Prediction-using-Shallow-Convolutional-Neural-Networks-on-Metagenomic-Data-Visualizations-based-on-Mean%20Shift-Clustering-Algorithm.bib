abstract = {Metagenomic data is a novel and valuable source for personalized medicine approaches to improve human health. Data Visualization is a crucial technique in data analysis to explore and find patterns in data. Especially, data resources from metagenomic often have very high dimension so humans face big challenges to understand them. In this study, we introduce a visualization method based on Mean-shift algorithm which enables us to observe high-dimensional data via images exhibiting clustered features by the clustering method. Then, these generated synthetic images are fetched into a convolutional neural network to do disease prediction tasks. The proposed method shows promising results when we evaluate the approach on four metagenomic bacterial species abundance datasets related to four diseases including Liver Cirrhosis, Colorectal Cancer, Obesity, and Type 2 Diabetes.},

First, the proposed model utilizes VGG16 and InceptionV3 to extract deep features from cotton and flax fiber images.

Finally, the generalized deep feature is used to train SoftMax classifier, thereby achieving accurate detection of cotton and flax fibers. In testing datasets which have 4008 images, the cotton and flax Fiber classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed model are 0.978, 0.969, 0.985 respectively.

abstract = {At present, both the point source and the imaging polarization navigation devices only can output the angle information, which means that the velocity information of the carrier cannot be extracted from the polarization field pattern directly. Optical flow is an image-based method for calculating the velocity of pixel point movement in an image. However, for ordinary optical flow, the difference in pixel value as well as the calculation accuracy can be reduced in weak light. Polarization imaging technology has the ability to improve both the detection accuracy and the recognition probability of the target because it can acquire the extra polarization multi-dimensional information of target radiation or reflection. In this paper, combining the polarization imaging technique with the traditional optical flow algorithm, a polarization optical flow algorithm is proposed, and it is verified that the polarized optical flow algorithm has good adaptation in weak light and can improve the application range of polarization navigation sensors. This research lays the foundation for day and night all-weather polarization navigation applications in future.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, metagenomics has become the preferred method for exploring complex microbiota such as human gut microbiota. However, several bias affecting the results of microbiota composition, such as those due to DNA extraction, have been reported. These bias have been confirmed with the development of culturomics technique. In the present study, we report the contamination of a gnotobiotic mice unit with a bacterium first detected by gram staining. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy permitted to detect a bacterium with a thick cell wall. However, in parallel, the first attempt to identify and culture this bacterium by gene amplification and metagenomics of universal 16S rRNA failed. Finally, the isolation in culture of a fastidious bacterium not detected by using universal PCR was successfully achieved by using a BCYE agar plate with CO2 atmosphere at 30 °C. We performed genome sequencing of this bacterium using a strong extraction procedure. The genomic comparison allowed us to classify this bacterium as Klenkia terrae. And finally, it was also detected in the stool and kibble that caused the contamination by using specific qPCR against this bacterium. The elucidation of this contamination provides additional evidence that DNA extraction could be a bias for the study of the microbiota. Currently, most studies that strive to analyze and compare the gut microbiota are based on metagenomics. In a gnotobiotic mice unit contaminated with the fastidious Actinobacteria Klenkia terrae, standard culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification and metagenomics failed to identify the micro-organism observed in stools by gram-staining. Only a procedure based on culturomics allowed us to identify this bacterium and to elucidate the mode of contamination of the gnotobiotic mice unit through diet.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
Blood culture contamination is a common and preventable problem in the emergency department (ED). In a previous single-center study, changing the process of ED blood culture collection from the traditional "clean," nonsterile procedure to a fully sterile procedure with standardized use of sterile gloves, large-volume chlorhexidine skin antisepsis, and fenestrated sterile drapes resulted in a substantial reduction in contamination. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this sterile blood culture collection process for reducing blood culture contamination in two community hospital EDs.


METHODS
The authors implemented the sterile blood culture collection process in the ED of two hospitals, including Hospital A, which historically had a contamination rate of approximately 5%, and Hospital B, with a 2.5% historical contamination rate. With an interrupted times-series design and segmented regression analysis to adjust for secular trends and autocorrelation, the monthly percentages of cultures contaminated at each hospital during an intervention period (sterile technique) were compared to a 10-month baseline period immediately preceding implementation (clean technique). At Hospital A, the full sterile blood culture collection process was used throughout the 16-month intervention period. At Hospital B, user feedback indicated poor adherence to the process due to difficulty implementing the fenestrated drape component; therefore, the process was simplified to the modified sterile collection process, in which the fenestrated drape component was dropped and sterile gloves and large-volume skin antisepsis were emphasized. Hence, at Hospital B, two intervention periods were compared to the baseline period: the 8-month intervention period 1 (full sterile process) and the subsequent 8-month intervention period 2 (modified sterile process).


RESULTS
At Hospital A, during the baseline period, 165 of 3,417 (4.83%) cultures were contaminated, while 142 of 5,238 (2.71%) were contaminated during the intervention period (p < 0.01). In the segmented regression model, the full sterile blood culture collection process was associated with an immediate 2.68% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.43% to 3.52%) absolute reduction in contamination and sustained reductions during the entire intervention period. At Hospital B, during the baseline, 63 of 2,509 (2.51%) cultures were contaminated. In intervention period 1 with the full sterile process, 51 of 1,865 (2.73%) cultures were contaminated (p = 0.65), with segmented regression results showing no changes compared to baseline. After simplification of the process to address poor adherence, the modified sterile process during intervention period 2 was associated with a significant reduction in contamination, with 17 of 1,860 (0.91%) cultures contaminated (p < 0.01 compared to baseline). The segmented regression model demonstrated the modified sterile process was associated with an immediate 1.53% (95% CI = 1.00% to 1.88%) absolute reduction in contamination with significant sustained reductions.


CONCLUSIONS
Changing the method of blood culture collection from the commonly used nonsterile technique to a sterile process resulted in significant reductions in blood culture contamination at two community hospital EDs, including one with low baseline contamination. Monitoring the implementation process at both sites was important to identify and overcome operational challenges. At one study site, simplification of the process by removing the fenestrated drape component was a key for successful implementation.},

These are non-contact sensors, which do not interfere with an athlete’s movement. The game elements detected by such measuring equipment can be used for game analysis, judgment, context recognition, and visualization. This paper proposes a method to automatically track the position of stones in curling sport images using computer vision technology. The authors extract the optimal feature vector of the mean-shift tracking algorithm by obtaining the optimal histogram from the color and edge information of the curling stone, thereby adaptively controlling the number of bins in the histogram. After evaluating the performance of the curling stone tracking method among 1424 image frames from curling sport videos, the authors found that the proposed method improved detection rate (overlap threshold = 0.9) by 14.85% compared to the general mean-shift method.},

This in turn increases the market price of crops and food, which increase the purchase burden of customers. Therefore, early identification and diagnosis of plant diseases at every stage of plant life cycle is a very critical approach to protect and increase the crop yield. In this paper using a deep-learning model, we present a classification system based on real-time images for early identification of plant infection prior of onset of severe disease symptoms at different life stages of a tomato plant infected with Tomato Mosaic Virus (TMV). The proposed classification was applied on each stage of the plant separately to obtain the largest data set and manifestation of each disease stage. The plant stages named in relation to disease stage as healthy (uninfected), early infection, and diseased (late infection). Classification was designed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and the accuracy rate was 97%. Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to increase the number of real-time images and then apply CNN on these new images and the accuracy rate was 98%.},

Firstly, MIOU loss includes three geometric factors in regression: the overlap area ratio, the center distance ratio, and the aspect ratio, which can better reflect the coincidence degree of target box and prediction box. Secondly, we improve the definition of aspect ratio loss to avoid gradient explosion, improve the optimization performance of prediction box. Finally, based on SiamPRN tracker, we compared the tracking performance of $$\ell _1$$
 -smooth loss, IOU loss, GIOU loss, DIOU loss, and MIOU loss. Experimental results show that the MIOU loss has better target location regression than other loss functions on the OTB2015 and VOT2016 benchmark, especially for the challenges of occlusion, illumination change and fast motion.},

Purpose
The purpose of this study is to establish an effective tracking algorithm for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on interacting multiple model (IMM) to take timely countermeasures against illegal flying UAVs.


Design/methodology/approach
In this paper, based on the constant velocity model (CV), the maneuvering adaptive current statistical model (CS) and the angular velocity adaptive three-dimensional (3D) fixed center constant speed rate constant steering rate model, a small UAV tracking algorithm based on adaptive interacting multiple model (AIMM-UKF) is proposed. In addition, an adaptive robust filter is added to each model of the algorithm. The linear Kalman filter algorithm is attached to the CV model and the CS model and the unscented Kalman filter algorithm (UKF) is attached to the CSCDR model to solve the nonlinearity of the 3D turning model.


Findings
Monte-Carlo simulation comparison with the other two IMM tracking algorithms shows that in the case of different movement modes and maneuvering strength of the UAV, the AIMM-UKF algorithm makes a good trade-off between the amount of calculation and filtering accuracy, which can maintain more accurate and stable tracking and has strong robustness. At the same time, after testing the actual observation data of the UAV, the results show that the AIMM-UKF algorithm state estimation trajectory can be regarded as an actual trajectory in practical engineering applications, which has good practical value.


Originality/value
This paper presents a new small UAV tracking algorithm based on IMM and the advantages and practicability of this algorithm compared with existing algorithms are proved through experiments.

abstract = {Modern radiologic images comply with DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) standard, which, upon conversion to other image format, would lose its image detail and information such as patient demographics or type of image modality that DICOM format carries. As there is a growing interest in using large amount of image data for research purpose and acquisition of large amount of medical image is now a standard practice in the clinical setting, efficient handling and storage of large amount of image data is important in both the clinical and research setting. In this study, four classes of images were created, namely, CT (computed tomography) of abdomen, CT of brain, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of brain and MRI of spine. After converting these images into JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format, our proposed CNN architecture could automatically classify these 4 groups of medical images by both their image modality and anatomic location. We achieved excellent overall classification accuracy in both validation and test sets (> 99.5%), specificity and F1 score (> 99%) in each category of this dataset which contained both diseased and normal images. Our study has shown that using CNN for medical image classification is a promising methodology and could work on non-DICOM images, which could potentially save image processing time and storage space.},

abstract = {Objective Blood culture collection practices that reduce contamination, such as sterile blood culture collection kits and phlebotomy teams, increase up-front costs for collecting cultures but may lead to net savings by eliminating downstream costs associated with contamination. The study objective was to compare overall hospital costs associated with 3 collection strategies: usual care, sterile kits, and phlebotomy teams. Design Cost analysis. Setting This analysis was conducted from the perspective of a hospital leadership team selecting a blood culture collection strategy for an adult emergency department (ED) with 8,000 cultures drawn annually. Methods Total hospital costs associated with 3 strategies were compared: (1) usual care, with nurses collecting cultures without a standardized protocol; (2) sterile kits, with nurses using a dedicated sterile collection kit; and (3) phlebotomy teams, with cultures collected by laboratory-based phlebotomists. In the base case, contamination rates associated with usual care, sterile kits, and phlebotomy teams were assumed to be 4.34%, 1.68%, and 1.10%, respectively. Total hospital costs included costs of collecting cultures and hospitalization costs according to culture results (negative, true positive, and contaminated). Results Compared with usual care, annual net savings using the sterile kit and phlebotomy team strategies were $483,219 and $288,980, respectively. Both strategies remained less costly than usual care across a broad range of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions EDs with high blood culture contamination rates should strongly consider evidence-based strategies to reduce contamination. In addition to improving quality, implementing a sterile collection kit or phlebotomy team strategy is likely to result in net cost savings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Blood culture contamination (BCC) is a common and avoidable complication of patient care and incurs considerable cost. A quality improvement (QI) initiative was undertaken at a large Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center to reduce the BCC rate.


METHODS
Lean management QI methods, including a rapid process improvement workshop (RPIW), were used to identify root causes of variation in blood culture procedures and countermeasures (potential improvement strategies) to address each problem were developed. BCC rates were collected for five and one quarter years, including the pre-RPIW (baseline) period, and changes in the contamination rates were calculated. The observed change in BCC rates was compared to a forecast of the pre-RPIW trend and estimated BCCs avoided. Results for the primary medical center were compared with those of a similarly complex VA medical center during the same time periods using difference-in-differences methodology.


RESULTS
Qualitative assessment of the processes of care identified four root cause problems, each of which was addressed with countermeasures. The BCC rate at the primary medical center decreased significantly from the baseline period in each year of follow-up, improving from 4.2% in the 19-month baseline period to 2.8% in the last 12 months of follow-up (April 2013-March 2014), while changes from baseline in the BCC rate at the comparison site were significant in only one year of follow-up. An estimated 261 BCCs were avoided at the primary medical center in the follow-up period.


CONCLUSION
The QI initiative was successful in reducing BCC rates and in producing continued improvement for nearly four years of follow-up. Further study will determine if these results are generalizable to other settings.},

abstract = {Deep Learning opened artificial intelligence to an unprecedented number of new applications. A critical success factor is the ability to train deeper neural networks, striving for stable and accurate models. This translates into Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that become unmanageable as the number of features increases. The novelty of our approach is to employ Network Science strategies to tackle the complexity of the actual ANNs at each epoch of the training process. The work presented herein originates in our earlier publications, where we explored the acceleration effects obtained by enforcing, in turn, scale freeness, small worldness, and sparsity during the ANN training process. The efficiency of our approach has also been recently confirmed by independent researchers, who managed to train a million-node ANN on non-specialized laptops. Encouraged by these results, we have now moved into having a closer look at some tunable parameters of our previous approach to pursue a further acceleration effect. We now investigate on the revise fraction parameter, to verify the necessity of the role of its double-check. Our method is independent of specific machine learning algorithms or datasets, since we operate merely on the topology of the ANNs. We demonstrate that the revise phase can be avoided in order to half the overall execution time with an almost negligible loss of quality.},

abstract = {The detection, determination of location, and identification of unknown and uncued energetic events within a large field of view represents a common operational requirement for many staring sensors. The traditional imaging approach involves forming an image of an extended scene and then rejecting background clutter. However, some important targets can be limited to a class of energetic, transient, point-like events, such as explosions, that embed key discriminants within their emitted, temporally varying spectra; for such events it is possible to create an alternative sensor architecture tuned specifically to these objects of interest. The resulting sensor operation, called pseudo imaging, includes: optical components designed to encode the scene information such that the spectral-temporal signature from the event and its location are easily derived; and signal processing intrinsic to the sensor to declare the presence of an event, locate the event, extract the event spectral-temporal signature, and match the signature to a library in order to identify the event. This treatise defines pseudo imaging, including formal specifications and requirements. Two examples of pseudo imaging sensors are presented: a sensor based on a spinning prism, and a sensor based on an optical element called a Crossed Dispersion Prism. The sensors are described, including how the sensors fulfill the definition of pseudo imaging, and measured data is presented to demonstrate functionality.},

abstract = {Abstract This study aimed to investigate the reliability of pseudo-computed tomography (pseudo-CT) imaging based on ultrasound (US) deformation fields under different binary masks in radiotherapy. We used 3-dimensional (3D) CT and US images, including those acquired during CT simulation positioning, and cone-beam CT (CBCT) and US images acquired 1 week after treating 3 patients with cervical cancer. Image data of 3 different layers were selected from the US images, and 3D CT images of each patient were selected. For US image registration, the following were created and applied: binary masks of the region of interest overlapping (ROIO) between the US image based on simulation positioning and US image for positioning verification, region of interest (ROI), whole overlapping (wholeO), and whole imaging region (whole). Accordingly, the deformation field was obtained and applied to CT images (CTsim), and different pseudo-CT images were acquired. Similarities between the pseudo-CT and CBCT images were compared, and registration accuracies between pseudo-CT images under different binary masks and CTsim were compared and discussed. A pair t test was conducted to normalized mutual information values of the registration accuracy between the pseudo-CT image based on ROIO binary mask and CTsim with other methods (P < .05), and the difference was statistically significant. A pair t test of normalized gray mean-squared errors was also performed (P < .05), and the difference was statistically significant. The similarity function means between pseudo-CT, that is, based on ROIO, ROI, wholeO, whole, and no binary mask, and CBCT were 0.9084, 0.8365, 0.7800, 0.6830, and 0.5518, respectively. Pseudo-CT based on ROIO binary mask best matched with CTsim and achieved the highest similarity with CBCT.},

abstract = {The etiology of central nervous system (CNS) infections such as meningitis and encephalitis remains unknown in a large proportion of cases partly because the diversity of pathogens that may cause CNS infections greatly outnumber available test methods. Here we present a metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) based approach for broad-range detection of pathogens associated with CNS infections, which is suitable for application in the acute care hospital setting. Using an Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencer and the IDseq pipeline for identifying pathogens in metagenomic sequence data, we show that the analytical sensitivity of mNGS to detect pathogens is comparable to that of PCR in simulated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens. We then applied this method for pathogen detection in 74 CSF specimens from patients with suspected CNS infections that were previously tested by culture and/or PCR. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of mNGS approach with reference to conventional methods were all 95%. Furthermore, confirmatory testing on specimens that gave discrepant results were mostly in favor of the mNGS assay. The clinical application of mNGS holds promise to benefit patients with CNS infections of unknown etiology.},

It is estimated that mortality, morbidity, therapy, and quarantine resulting from BRDC account for significant losses in the cattle industry. Early detection and management of BRDC are crucial in mitigating economic losses. Current animal disease diagnostics is based on traditional tests such as bacterial culture, serolog, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests. Advancements of data analytics and machine learning are setting trends in several metagenome sequencing applications. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach to identify pathogen signatures present in bovine metagenome sequences using k-mer-based network embedding followed by a deep learning-based classification task. With experiments conducted on two different simulated datasets, we show that networks-based deep learning approaches can detect pathogen signatures with up to 89.7% accuracy. We will make the simulated data used in our experiments available publicly upon request to tackle this important problem with more innovative approaches.},

abstract = {Object tracking is critical and difficult task when it comes to unmanned air vehicles and traffic surveillance. The major challenge in object tracking is occlusion handling either partial occlusion or full occlusion. In this paper modified mean-shift tracking algorithm is proposed to tackle the problem of full occlusion. Mean-shift object tracking algorithm uses the color information to represent the target and to localize it in next frame. So when the object gets occluded with other object having similar colors, mean-shift tracking algorithm easily lost the target. In this modified mean-shift algorithm implementation, traditional mean-shift algorithm is lumped with the motion information associated with the spatial information of the moving object. Spatial information was exploited to handle the full occlusions present in the video. The object moves from one pixel to other in two consecutive frames its information about pixel index was stored in new variables. This information was used to capture the correct object when it reappears in the video, after the occlusion. Many videos were used to test the proposed tracking algorithm. Two examples were presented in this paper, which successfully cope with the partial occlusions, full occlusions and full occlusions when both the objects have exactly same colors.

Finally, the estimated glucose concentration is associated with the obtained mode. We show that binning the images increases the mode detection accuracy. Using both synthetic and real data, we validate the proposed algorithm.},

The scenario is segmented by the mean-shift algorithm and the pixel gradient of foreground is calculated. After pretreatment of edge detection and morphological operation, the depth information and infrared information are fused. The characteristics of depth map and infrared image in edge detection are used for the raised method, the false rate of detection is reduced, and detection precision is improved. Since the depth map and infrared image are not affected by natural sunlight, the influence on obstacle recognition due to the factors such as light intensity and shadow is effectively reduced and the robustness of the algorithm is also improved. Experiments indicate that the detection algorithm of information fusion can accurately identify the small obstacle in the view and the accuracy of obstacle recognition will not be affected by light. Hence, this method has great significance for mobile robot or intelligent vehicles on obstacle detection in outdoor environment.},

Hybrid MPMS is an. iterative method that combines two mean shift procedures called nonblurring and blurring. Our method was positively tested on a set of simulated ultrasound data. The results show the superiority of hybrid MPMS compared to the simple MPMS filtering.},

The performance of the proposed 3D tracking algorithm is compared to the traditional 2D mean-shift algorithm in terms of tracking accuracy and speed. Results show that in general the tracking accuracy is improved while requiring more processing time. Nonetheless, the algorithm executes at a rate which is faster than typical video capturing rates and thus has no impact on the performance of the tracking system.},
