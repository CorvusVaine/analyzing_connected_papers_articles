 The gut microbiome-type 2 diabetes (T2D) relationship among human cohorts have been controversial. We hypothesized that this limitation could be addressed by integrating the cutting-edge interpretable machine learning framework and large-scale human cohort studies.
 
 
 
 3 independent cohorts with >9000 participants were included in this study. We proposed a new machine learning-based analytic framework — using LightGBM to infer the relationship between incorporated features and T2D, and SHapley Additive explanation(SHAP) to identified microbiome features associated with the risk of T2D. We then generated a microbiome risk score (MRS) integrating the threshold and direction of the identified microbiome features to predict T2D risk.
 
 
 
 We finally identified 15 microbiome features (two of them are indicators of microbial diversity, others are taxa-related features) associated with the risk of T2D. The identified T2D-related gut microbiome features showed superior T2D prediction accuracy compared to host genetics or traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we found that the MRS (per unit change in MRS) consistently showed positive association with T2D risk in the discovery cohort (RR 1.28, 95%CI 1.23-1.33), external validation cohort 1 (RR 1.23, 95%CI 1.13-1.34) and external validation cohort 2 (GGMP, RR 1.12, 95%CI 1.06-1.18). The MRS could also predict future glucose increment. We subsequently identified dietary and lifestyle factors which could prospectively modulate the microbiome features, and found that body fat distribution may be the key factor modulating the gut microbiome-T2D relationship.
 
 
 
 Taken together, we proposed a new analytical framework for the investigation of microbiome-disease relationship. The identified microbiome features may serve as potential drug targets for T2D in future.

abstract = {As more than 90% of microbial community could not be isolated and cultivated, the metagenomic methods have been commonly used to analyze the microbial community as a whole. With the fast acumination of metagenomic samples, it is now intriguing to find simple biomarkers, especially functional biomarkers, which could distinguish different metagenomic samples. Next-generation sequencing techniques have enabled the detection of very accurate gene-presence (abundance) values in metagenomic studies. And the presence/absence or different abundance values for a set of genes could be used as appropriate biomarker for identification of the corresponding microbial community's phenotype. However, it is not yet clear how to select such a set of genes (features), and how accurate would it be for such a set of selected genes on prediction of microbial community's phenotype. In this study, we have evaluated different machine learning methods, including feature selection methods and classification methods, for selection of biomarkers that could distinguish different samples. Then we proposed a machine learning framework, which could discover biomarkers for different microbial communities from the mining of metagenomic data. Given a set of features (genes) and their presence values in multiple samples, we first selected discriminative features as candidate by feature selection, and then selected the feature sets with low error rate and classification accuracies as biomarkers by classification method. We have selected whole genome sequencing data from simulation, public domain and in-house metagenomic data generation facilities. We tested the framework on prediction and evaluation of the biomarkers. Results have shown that the framework could select functional biomarkers with very high accuracy. Therefore, this framework would be a suitable tool to discover functional biomarkers to distinguish different microbial communities.},

abstract = {It is currently unknown whether associations between gut microbiota composition and type 2 diabetes (T2D) differ according to the ethnic background of individuals. Thus, we studied these associations in participants from two ethnicities characterized by a high T2D prevalence and living in the same geographical area, using the Healthy Life In Urban Settings (HELIUS) study. We included 111 and 128 T2D participants on metformin (Met-T2D), 78 and 49 treatment-naïve T2D (TN-T2D) participants, as well as a 1:1 matched group of healthy controls from, respectively, African Surinamese and South-Asian Surinamese descent. Fecal microbiome profiles were obtained through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Univariate and machine learning analyses were used to explore the associations between T2D and the composition and function of the gut microbiome in both ethnicities, comparing Met-T2D and TN-T2D participants to their respective healthy control. We found a lower α-diversity for South-Asian Surinamese TN-T2D participants but no significant associations between TN-T2D status and the abundance of bacterial taxa or functional pathways. In African Surinamese participants, we did not find any association between TN-T2D status and the gut microbiome. With respect to Met-T2D participants, we identified several bacterial taxa and functional pathways with a significantly altered abundance in both ethnicities. More alterations were observed in South-Asian Surinamese. Some altered taxa and pathways observed in both ethnicities were previously related to metformin use. This included a strong negative association between the abundance of Romboutsia and Met-T2D status. Other bacterial taxa were consistent with previous observations in T2D, including reduced butyrate producers such as Anaerostipes hadrus. Hence, our results highlighted both shared and unique gut microbial biomarkers of Met-T2D in individuals from different ethnicities but living in the same geographical area. Future research using higher-resolution shotgun sequencing is needed to clarify the role of ethnicity in the association between T2D and gut microbiota composition.},

abstract = {Motivation Continuous emergence of new variants through appearance, accumulation and disappearance of mutations in viruses is a hallmark of many viral diseases. SARS-CoV-2 and its variants have particularly exerted tremendous pressure on global healthcare system owing to their life threatening and debilitating implications. The sheer plurality of the variants and huge scale of genome sequence data available for Covid19 have added to the challenges of traceability of mutations of concern. The latter however provides an opportunity to utilize SARS-CoV-2 genomes and the mutations therein as ‘big data records’ to comprehensively classify the variants through the (machine) learning of mutation patterns. The unprecedented sequencing effort and tracing of disease outcomes provide an excellent ground for identifying important mutations by developing machine learnt models or severity classifiers using mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2. This is expected to provide a significant impetus to the efforts towards not only identifying the mutations of concern but also exploring the potential of mutation driven predictive prognosis of SARS-CoV-2. Results We describe how a graduated approach of building various severity specific machine learning classifiers, using only the mutation corpus of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, can potentially lead to the identification of important mutations and guide potential prognosis of infection. We demonstrate the applicability of model derived important mutations and use of Shapley values in order to identify the significant mutations of concern as well as for developing sparse models of outcome classification. A total of 77,284 outcome traced SARS-CoV-2 genomes were employed in this study which represented a total corpus of 30346 unique nucleotide mutations and 18647 amino acid mutations. Machine learning models pertaining to graduated classifiers of target outcomes namely ‘Asymptomatic, Mild, Symptomatic/Moderate, Severe and Fatal’ were built considering the TRIPOD guidelines for predictive prognosis. Shapley values for model linked important mutations were employed to select significant mutations leading to identification of less than 20 outcome driving mutations from each classifier. We additionally describe the significance of adopting a ‘temporal modeling approach’ to benchmark the predictive prognosis linked with continuously evolving pathogens. A chronologically distinct sampling is important in evaluating the performance of models trained on ‘past data’ in accurately classifying prognosis linked with genomes of future (observed with new mutations). We conclude that while machine learning approach can play a vital role in identifying relevant mutations, caution should be exercised in using the mutation signatures for predictive prognosis in cases where new mutations have accumulated along with the previously observed mutations of concern.

abstract = {Causal inference in biomedical research allows us to shift the paradigm from investigating associational relationships to causal ones. Inferring causal relationships can help in understanding the inner workings of biological processes. Association patterns can be coincidental and may lead to wrong conclusions about causality in complex systems. Microbiomes are highly complex, diverse, and dynamic environments. Microbes are key players in human health and disease. Hence knowledge of critical causal relationships among the entities in a microbiome, and the impact of internal and external factors on microbial abundance and their interactions are essential for understanding disease mechanisms and making appropriate treatment recommendations. In this paper, we employ causal inference techniques to understand causal relationships between various entities in a microbiome, and to use the resulting causal network to make useful computations. We introduce a novel pipeline for microbiome analysis, which includes adding an outcome or “disease” variable, and then computing the causal network, referred to as a “disease network”, with the goal of identifying disease-relevant causal factors from the microbiome. Internventional techniques are then applied to the resulting network, allowing us to compute a measure called the causal effect of one or more microbial taxa on the outcome variable or the condition of interest. Finally, we propose a measure called causal influence that quantifies the total influence exerted by a microbial taxon on the rest of the microiome. Our pipeline is robust, sensitive, different from traditional approaches, and able to predict interventional effects without any controlled experiments. The pipeline can be used to identify potential eubiotic and dysbiotic microbial taxa in a microbiome. We validate our results using synthetic data sets and using results on real data sets that were previously published.},

abstract = {Microbial amplicon sequencing studies are an important tool in biological and biomedical research. Widespread 16S rRNA gene microbial surveys have shed light on the structure of many ecosystems inhabited by bacteria, including the human body. However, specialized software and algorithms are needed to convert raw sequencing data into biologically meaningful information (i.e. tables of bacterial counts). While different bioinformatic pipelines are available in a rapidly changing and improving field, users are often unaware of limitations and biases associated with individual pipelines and there is a lack of agreement regarding best practices. Here, we compared six bioinformatic pipelines for the analysis of amplicon sequence data: three OTU-level flows (QIIME-uclust, MOTHUR, and USEARCH-UPARSE) and three ASV-level (DADA2, Qiime2-Deblur, and USEARCH-UNOISE3). We tested workflows with different quality control options, clustering algorithms, and cutoff parameters on a mock community as well as on a large (N = 2170) recently published fecal sample dataset from the multi-ethnic HELIUS study. We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and degree of consensus of the different outputs. DADA2 offered the best sensitivity, at the expense of decreased specificity compared to USEARCH-UNOISE3 and Qiime2-Deblur. USEARCH-UNOISE3 showed the best balance between resolution and specificity. OTU-level USEARCH-UPARSE and MOTHUR performed well, but with lower specificity than ASV-level pipelines. QIIME-uclust produced large number of spurious OTUs as well as inflated alpha-diversity measures and should be avoided in future studies. This study provides guidance for researchers using amplicon sequencing to gain biological insights.},

abstract = {Microbiota-host-diet interactions contribute to the development of metabolic diseases. Imidazole propionate is a novel microbially produced metabolite from histidine, which impairs glucose metabolism. Here, we show that subjects with prediabetes and diabetes in the MetaCardis cohort from three European countries have elevated serum imidazole propionate levels. Furthermore, imidazole propionate levels were increased in subjects with low bacterial gene richness and Bacteroides 2 enterotype, which have previously been associated with obesity. The Bacteroides 2 enterotype was also associated with increased abundance of the genes involved in imidazole propionate biosynthesis from dietary histidine. Since patients and controls did not differ in their histidine dietary intake, the elevated levels of imidazole propionate in type 2 diabetes likely reflects altered microbial metabolism of histidine, rather than histidine intake per se. Thus the microbiota may contribute to type 2 diabetes by generating imidazole propionate that can modulate host inflammation and metabolism.},

We found that 23% of the total compositional variance was explained by intra-individual variation. The degree of intra-individual compositional variability was negatively associated with the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (a butyrate producer) and two Bifidobacterium species. By contrast, the abundance of facultative anaerobes and aerotolerant bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus varied extensively, independent of compositional stability. The contribution of intra-individual variance to the total variance was greater for functional pathways than for microbial species. Thus, reliable quantification of microbial features requires repeated samples to address the issue of intra-individual variations of the gut microbiota.},

White individuals were enriched for the mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila. East Asian subjects had increased levels of multiple bacterial phyla, fermentative pathways detected by metagenomics, and the short-chain fatty acid end-products acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. Differences in the gut microbiota between the East Asian and White subjects could not be explained by dietary intake, were more pronounced in lean individuals, and were associated with current geographical location. Microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice demonstrated stable diet- and host genotype-independent differences between the gut microbiotas of East Asian and White individuals that differentially impact host body composition.

abstract = {As the treatment regimens such as metformin could confound the correlation between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gut microbiome, we should revisit the relationship between gut microbiota and T2D patients who are not currently treated with metformin. The study recruited 65 T2D patients: 49 with and 16 without diabetic complications, and 35 healthy controls. We sequenced the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of gut microbiota and detected metabolites based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in faecal samples. The composition of both the gut microbiota and faecal metabolites changed significantly with T2D patients. The abundance of Proteobacteria and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes were higher in T2D patients than healthy subjects, and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids and lipids of T2D patients were significantly disordered. Moreover, the abundances of certain SCFA-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae etc.) were significantly increased in T2D patients, while the faecal SCFAs concentrations were significantly decreased. It’s suggested that the role of SCFA-producing bacteria was not simply to produce SCFAs. Then we identified 44 microbial modules to explore the correlations between the gut microbiota and metabolic traits. Specially, most modules including certain SCFA-producing bacteria were comprehensively correlated to body mass index, the levels of blood glucose, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and faecal bile acids and lipids. Our study identified the relationships between the gut microbiota and faecal metabolites, and provided a resource for future studies to understand host–gut microbiota interactions in T2D.},

Asthmatics could not be distinguished from non-asthmatics based on individual microbiota composition by an extremely randomized trees classifier model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.54).

In 2019, around 463 million adults were living with diabetes mellitus, and T2DM accounted for 90 to 95% of cases. The relationship between the gut microbiota and T2DM has been explored with the advent of metagenomic techniques. Genome-wide association studies evaluating the microbiota of these individuals have pointed to taxonomic, functional, and microbial metabolite imbalances and represent a potential intervention in T2DM management. Several microbial metabolites and components, such as imidazole propionate, trimethylamine, and lipopolysaccharides, appear to impair insulin signaling, while short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites may improve it. In addition, the use of probiotics with the aim of transiently restoring the microbial balance or reducing the effects of microbial metabolites that impair insulin sensitivity has been explored. Herein, we critically review the available literature on the changes in the gut microbiota in T2DM together with potential adjuvant therapies that may improve the health status of this population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Recent studies suggest the beneficial effects of metformin on glucose metabolism may be microbially mediated. We examined the association of type 2 diabetes, metformin, and gut microbiota in community-dwelling Colombian adults. On the basis of previous research, we hypothesized that metformin is associated with higher levels of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)–producing and mucin-degrading microbiota. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were selected from a larger cohort of 459 participants. The present analyses focus on the 28 participants diagnosed with diabetes—14 taking metformin— and the 84 participants without diabetes who were matched (3-to-1) to participants with diabetes by sex, age, and BMI. We measured demographic information, anthropometry, and blood biochemical parameters and collected fecal samples from which we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the composition and structure of the gut microbiota. RESULTS We found an association between diabetes and gut microbiota that was modified by metformin use. Compared with participants without diabetes, participants with diabetes taking metformin had higher relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a microbiota known for mucin degradation, and several gut microbiota known for production of SCFAs, including Butyrivibrio, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Megasphaera, and an operational taxonomic unit of Prevotella. In contrast, compared with participants without diabetes, participants with diabetes not taking metformin had higher relative abundance of Clostridiaceae 02d06 and a distinct operational taxonomic unit of Prevotella and a lower abundance of Enterococcus casseliflavus. CONCLUSIONS Our results support the hypothesis that metformin shifts gut microbiota composition through the enrichment of mucin-degrading A. muciniphila as well as several SCFA-producing microbiota. Future studies are needed to determine if these shifts mediate metformin’s glycemic and anti-inflammatory properties.},

The composition and diversity of gut microbiome were investigated in fecal DNA samples using Illumina sequencing of the V3∼V4 regions of 16sRNA. Results There were significant differences in the number of bacteria among patients with PreDM and T2DM and the control group. Compared with the control group, Proteobacteria bacteria were significantly higher in the PreDM group (P = 0.006). On the genus level, Compared with the control group, the relative abundance of Prevotella and Alloprevotella was significantly higher in the T2DM group (P = 0.016, P = 0.018), and the relative abundance of Paraprevotella in T2DM and PreDM groups was lower than that in the control group (P = 0.011, P = 0.045). Compared with the PreDM group and the control group, the relative abundance of Bacteroides in the T2DM group was significantly lower (P = 0.019, P = 0.002). Conclusions The present study found significant differences in the gut microbiome between PreDM, T2DM and non-diabetic individuals, specifically at the genus level, suggesting that early intervention in PreDM patients could have implications for gut flora transitioning to T2DM. In addition, these results may be valuable for developing strategies to control T2DM by modifying the gut microbiome.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex disorder comprehensively influenced by genetic and environmental risk, and research increasingly has indicated the role of microbial dysbiosis in T2DM pathogenesis. However, studies comparing the microbiome characteristics between T2DM and healthy controls have reported inconsistent results. To further identify and describe the characteristics of the intestinal flora of T2DM patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of stool microbial profiles to discern and describe microbial dysbiosis in T2DM and to explore heterogeneity among 7 studies (600 T2DM cases, 543 controls, 1143 samples in total). Using a random effects model and a fixed effects model, we observed significant differences in beta diversity, but not alpha diversity, between individuals with T2DM and controls. We identified various operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) and bacterial genera with significant odds ratios for T2DM. The T2DM signatures derived from a single study by stepwise feature selection could be applied in other studies. By training on multiple studies, we improved the detection accuracy and disease specificity for T2DM. We also discuss the relationship between T2DM-enriched or T2DM-depleted genera and probiotics and provide new ideas for diabetes prevention and improvement.},

abstract = {The product investigated herein is the dried rhizome of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. [Asteraceae] (Baizhu), which is also known as Dongbaizhu, Wuzhu, Yuzhu, Zhezhu, and Zhongzhu, among others. It invigorates the spleen, replenishes qi, and removes dampness, diuresis, and hidroschesis, and impacts fetal safety. It is often used for the treatment of diseases such as spleen function deficiency, abdominal distension, diarrhea, sputum, vertigo, edema, fever, and sweating and also aids cessation of minimal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. In this study, research pertaining to the ethnopharmacology, application, phytochemistry, analytical methods, quality control, processing, pharmacology, toxicology, and pharmacokinetics of Baizhu has been reviewed. Relevant information and data reported for Baizhu were collected from CNKI, VIP, PubMed, Web of Science, scientific databases, Chinese Medicinal Material Encyclopedia, Chinese herbal medicine classics, Chinese medicine dictionary, doctoral and master’s theses, and so on. Baizhu demonstrates diuretic, antidiuretic, anti-inflammatory effects and antitumor function and aids regulation of gastrointestinal function, hypoglycemic effect, analgesic action, protection on the liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rats, inhibition of aromatase, treatment of bone disease, strengthening myocardial contraction ability, detoxification and cholagogic effect, fall hematic fat action, such as the treatment of acute renal injury, and so on. It also can be an anticoagulant, improve the nervous system disease, affect the immune system, and regulate uterine smooth muscle, antioxidation, antiaging, and antibacterial effect. Sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, polyacetylenes, phenylpropanoids, coumarins, flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, steroids, benzoquinones, polysaccharides, and other compounds were isolated from Baizhu. Among them, sesquiterpenoids, polysaccharides, and polyacetylenes are the main components of Baizhu. Baizhu exhibits a wide range of pharmacological effects and constitutes a considerable proportion of the composition of many proprietary crude drugs. It mainly affects the endocrine, nervous, and urinary systems. The presented information suggests that we should focus on the development of new drugs related to Baizhu, including specific components, to achieve a greater therapeutic potential that can be considered to further explore the information related to Baizhu.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Alterations in the gut microbiome composition or function are associated with risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. Based on recent evidence that also oral medications used to treat these conditions could alter the gut microbiome composition and function and, vice versa, that the gut microbiome could affect the efficacy of these treatments, we reviewed the literature on these observed interactions.


RECENT FINDINGS
While the interaction of metformin with the gut microbiome has been studied most, other drugs that target cardiometabolic risk are gaining attention and often showed associations with alterations in microbiome-related features, including alterations in specific microbial taxa or pathways, microbiome composition or microbiome-derived metabolites, while the gut microbiome was also involved in drug metabolism and drug efficacy. As for metformin, for some of them even a potential therapeutic effect via the gut microbiome is postulated. However, exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated.


SUMMARY
There is growing interest in clarifying the interactions between the gut microbiome and drugs to treat hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia as well as the first pass effect of microbiome on drug efficacy. While mostly analysed in animal models, also human studies are gaining more and more traction. Improving the understanding of the gut microbiome drug interaction can provide clinical directions for therapy by optimizing drug efficacy or providing new targets for drug development.},

abstract = {Biogeographic variations in the gut microbiota reflect host and environmental factors delineating human populations, and are pivotal to understand global patterns of host-microbiota interactions in health and prevalent lifestyle-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Pakistani adults, having an exceptionally high prevalence of T2D, are one of the most understudied populations in microbiota research to date. The aim of the present study is to examine the gut microbiota across individuals from Pakistan and other populations of non-industrialized and industrialized lifestyles with a focus on T2D. The fecal samples from 94 urban-dwelling Pakistani adults with and without T2D were profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, and plasma samples quantified for circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and the activation ability of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-signaling. Publicly available datasets generated with comparable molecular methods were retrieved for comparative analysis. Overall, urbanized Pakistanis’ gut microbiota was similar to that of transitional or non-industrialized populations, depleted in Akkermansiaceae and enriched in Prevotellaceae (dominated by the non-Westernized clades of Prevotella copri). The relatively high proportion of Atopobiaceae appeared to be a unique characteristic of the Pakistani gut microbiota. The Pakistanis with T2D had elevated levels of LBP and TLR-signaling in circulation as well as gut microbial signatures atypical of other populations e.g., increased relative abundance of Libanicoccus/Parolsenella, limiting the inter-population extrapolation of gut microbiota-based classifiers for T2D. Taken together, our findings call for more global representation of understudied populations to extend the applicability of microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics.},

We observed that overall gut microbiota composition was altered in groups with impaired glucose tolerance, combined glucose intolerance and T2D, but not in those with impaired fasting glucose. In addition, the abundance of several butyrate producers and functional potential for butyrate production were decreased both in prediabetes and T2D groups. Multivariate analyses and machine learning microbiome models indicated that insulin resistance was strongly associated with microbial variations. Therefore, our study indicates that the gut microbiota represents an important modifiable factor to consider when developing precision medicine approaches for the prevention and/or delay of T2D.},

abstract = {Abstract The theory of ominous octet proposed by Dr. Defronzo in 2008 has emphasized the underlying complicated pathogenesis mechanism in type 2 diabetes. Recently it was further identified that gut microbiota dysbiosis is also closely related to development of chronic inflammations related diseases including diabetes. Diabetes is characterized by "leaky gut" syndrome where bacterial cell wall components enter the blood circulation of animal host in a higher amount. These may cause metabolic endotoxemia and systemic low-grade inflammation, affecting vital organs related to the ominous octet. On the other hand, the bacterial metabolites also systemically affect glucose homeostasis and energy utilization. The effects of current clinically available oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) are related to altering the compositions of gut microbiota, among which metformin are the most extensively explored. Gut microbiota therefore play an important role as a functional cross-bridge between host environment and the ominous octet, modulating diabetes. With continuing explorations, in the future gut microbiota may serve as a diagnostic biomarker in personalized medicine. Its modulation may also be used as a novel approach to treat type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
The increasing prevalence of obesity over the past few decades constitutes a global health challenge. Pharmacological therapy is recommended to accompany life-style modification for obesity management. Here, we perform a clinical trial to investigate the effects of metformin on anthropometric indices and gut microbiota composition in non-diabetic, treatment-naive obese women with a low calorie diet (LCD).


DESIGN
Randomized double-blind parallel-group clinical trial Methods: Forty-six obese women were randomly assigned to the metformin (500 mg/tab) or placebo groups using computer-generated random numbers. Subjects in both groups took two tablets per day for two months. Anthropometric measurements and collection of blood and faecal samples were done at the baseline and at the end of the trial. Gut microbiota composition was assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.


RESULTS
Twenty-four and twenty-two subjects were included in the metformin+LCD and placebo+LCD groups, respectively; at the end of trial twenty and sixteen subjects were analyzed. The metformin+LCD and placebo+LCD caused a 4.5% and 2.6% decrease in BMI from the baseline values, respectively (P<0.01). Insulin concentration decreased in the metformin+LCD group (P=0.046). The overall faecal microbiota composition and diversity were unaffected in the metformin+LCD group. However, a significant specific increase in Escherichia/Shigella abundance was observed after metformin+LCD intervention (P=0.026). Faecal acetate concentration, but not producers, was significantly higher in the placebo+LCD group, adjusted for baseline values and BMI (P=0.002).


CONCLUSIONS
Despite the weight reduction after metformin intake, the overall faecal microbiota composition remained largely unchanged in obese women, with exception of changes in specific Proteobacterial groups.},

abstract = {Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a multifactorial disease influenced by host genetics and environmental factors, is the most common endocrine disease. Several studies have shown that the gut microbiota as a close-up environmental mediator influences host physiology including metabolism. The aim of the present study is to examine the compositional and functional potential of the gut microbiota across individuals from Denmark and South India with a focus on T2D. Many earlier studies have investigated the microbiome aspects of T2D, and it has also been anticipated that such microbial associations would be dependent on diet and ethnic origin. However, there has been no large scale trans-ethnic microbiome study earlier in this direction aimed at evaluating any “universal” microbiome signature of T2D. Methods 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples from 279 Danish and 294 Indian study participants. Any differences between the gut microbiota of both populations were explored using diversity measures and negative binomial Wald tests. Study samples were stratified to discover global and country-specific microbial signatures for T2D and treatment with the anti-hyperglycemic drug, metformin. To identify taxonomical and functional signatures of the gut microbiota for T2D and metformin treatment, we used alpha and beta diversity measures and differential abundances analysis, comparing metformin-naive T2D patients, metformin-treated T2D patients, and normoglycemic individuals. Results Overall, the gut microbial communities of Danes and Indians are compositionally very different. By analyzing the combined study materials, we identify microbial taxonomic and functional signatures for T2D and metformin treatment. T2D patients have an increased relative abundance of two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the Lachnospiraceae family, and a decreased abundance of Subdoligranulum and Butyricicoccus . Studying each population per se , we identified T2D-related microbial changes at the taxonomic level within the Danish population only. Alpha diversity indices show that there is no significant difference between normoglycemic individuals and metformin-naive T2D patients, whereas microbial richness is significantly decreased in metformin-treated T2D patients compared to metformin-naive T2D patients and normoglycemic individuals. Enrichment of two OTUs from Bacteroides and depletion of Faecalibacterium constitute a trans-ethnic signature of metformin treatment. Conclusions We demonstrate major compositional differences of the gut microbiota between Danish and South Indian individuals, some of which may relate to differences in ethnicity, lifestyle, and demography. By comparing metformin-naive T2D patients and normoglycemic individuals, we identify T2D-related microbiota changes in the Danish and Indian study samples. In the present trans-ethnic study, we confirm that metformin changes the taxonomic profile and functional potential of the gut microbiota.},

abstract = {Metagenomics studies have shown that type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an altered gut microbiota. Whereas different microbiota patterns have been observed in independent human cohorts, reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria has consistently been found in individuals with T2D, as well as in those with prediabetes. Butyrate is produced in the large intestine by microbial fermentations, particularly of dietary fiber, and serves as primary fuel for colonocytes. It also acts as histone deacetylase inhibitor and ligand to G-protein coupled receptors, affecting cellular signaling in target cells, such as enteroendocrine cells. Therefore, butyrate has become an attractive drug target for T2D, and treatment strategies have been devised to increase its intestinal levels, for example by supplementation of butyrate-producing bacteria and dietary fiber, or through fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). In this review, we provide an overview of current literature indicating that these strategies have yielded encouraging results and short-term benefits in humans, but long-term improvements of glycemic control have not been reported so far. Further studies are required to find effective approaches to restore butyrate-producing bacteria and butyrate levels in the human gut, and to investigate their impact on glucose regulation in T2D.},

We found that MSI significantly improved DSS-induced weight loss, colon shortening, hematochezia, DAI score, histopathology, and antioxidant indices (SOD and MDA). Further analysis demonstrated that MSI could significantly down-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ) and up-regulate the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by regulating TLR4/NF-κB and NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1 signal pathway. Moreover, tight junction proteins in melanin groups were also maintained by ZO-1 and occludin expressions. In addition, MSI also regulated cellular apoptosis by reducing the expression of pro-apoptosis protein Caspase-3. Interestingly, MSI treatments increased the proportion of dominant bacteria (such as Bacteroidetes and Clostridium) and the abundance of community (alpha diversity, β-diversity, etc.), which significantly balanced microbiota in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, oral administration of MSI alleviated DSS-induced colitis by modulating inflammatory cytokines and oxidation stress, maintaining the mucosal barrier, and reverting microbiota changes.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesisIndividuals with type 2 diabetes have an altered bacterial composition of their gut microbiota compared with non-diabetic individuals. However, these alterations may be confounded by medication, notably the blood-glucose-lowering biguanide, metformin. We undertook a clinical trial in healthy and previously drug-free men with the primary aim of investigating metformin-induced compositional changes in the non-diabetic state. A secondary aim was to examine whether the pre-treatment gut microbiota was related to gastrointestinal adverse effects during metformin treatment.MethodsTwenty-seven healthy young Danish men were included in an 18-week one-armed crossover trial consisting of a pre-intervention period, an intervention period and a post-intervention period, each period lasting 6 weeks. Inclusion criteria were men of age 18–35 years, BMI between 18.5 kg/m2 and 27.5 kg/m2, HbA1c < 39 mmol/mol (5.7%) and plasma creatinine within the normal range. No prescribed medication, including antibiotics, for 2 months prior to recruitment were allowed and no previous gastrointestinal surgery, discounting appendectomy or chronic illness requiring medical treatment. During the intervention the participants were given metformin up to 1 g twice daily. Participants were examined five times in the fasting state with blood sampling and recording of gastrointestinal symptoms. Examinations took place at Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark before and after the pre-intervention period, halfway through and immediately after the end of intervention and after the wash-out period. Faecal samples were collected at nine evenly distributed time points, and bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in order to evaluate gut microbiota composition. Subjective gastrointestinal symptoms were reported at each visit.ResultsData from participants who completed visit 1 (n=23) are included in analyses. For the primary outcome the relative abundance of 11 bacterial genera significantly changed during the intervention but returned to baseline levels after treatment cessation. In line with previous reports, we observed a reduced abundance of Intestinibacter spp. and Clostridium spp., as well as an increased abundance of Escherichia/Shigella spp. and Bilophila wadsworthia. The relative abundance at baseline of 12 bacterial genera predicted self-reported gastrointestinal adverse effects.Conclusions/interpretationIntake of metformin changes the gut microbiota composition in normoglycaemic young men. The microbiota changes induced by metformin extend and validate previous reports in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Secondary analyses suggest that pre-treatment gut microbiota composition may be a determinant for development of gastrointestinal adverse effects following metformin intake. These results require further investigation and replication in larger prospective studies.Trial registrationClinicaltrialsregister.eu 2015-000199-86 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02546050FundingThis project was funded by Danish Diabetes Association and The Novo Nordisk Foundation},

abstract = {Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is a major health problem affecting approximately 25% of the worldwide population. Since the gut microbiota is highly connected to the host metabolism, several recent studies have emerged to characterize the role of the microbiome in MetSyn development and progression. To this end, our study aimed to identify the microbiome patterns which distinguish MetSyn from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on a cohort of 70 individuals among which 40 were MetSyn patients. The microbiome of MetSyn patients was characterised by reduced diversity, loss of butyrate producers (Subdoligranulum, Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and enrichment in the relative abundance of fungal populations. We also show a link between the gut microbiome and lipid metabolism in MetSyn. Specifically, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) display a positive effect on gut microbial diversity. When interrogating the signature of gut microbiota in a subgroup of patients harbouring both MetSyn and T2DM conditions, we observed a significant increase in taxa such as Bacteroides, Clostridiales, and Erysipelotrichaceae. This preliminary study shows for the first time that T2DM brings unique signatures of gut microbiota in MetSyn patients. We also highlight the impact of metformin treatment on the gut microbiota. Metformin administration was linked to changes in Prevotellaceae, Rickenellaceae, and Clostridiales. Further research focusing on the microbiome-metabolome patterns is needed to clarify the exact association of various gut microbial communities with the progression of T2DM and the occurrence of various complications in MetSyn patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the longer-term effects of metformin treatment and behavioral weight loss on gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a 3-parallel-arm, randomized trial. We enrolled overweight/obese adults who had been treated for solid tumors but had no ongoing cancer treatment and randomized them (n = 121) to either 1) metformin (up to 2,000 mg), 2) coach-directed behavioral weight loss, or 3) self-directed care (control) for 12 months. We collected stool and serum at baseline (n = 114), 6 months (n = 109), and 12 months (n = 105). From stool, we extracted microbial DNA and conducted amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. We measured SCFAs and other biochemical parameters from fasting serum. RESULTS Of the 121 participants, 79% were female and 46% were Black, and the mean age was 60 years. Only metformin treatment significantly altered microbiota composition. Compared with control, metformin treatment increased amplicon sequence variants for Escherichia (confirmed as Escherichia coli by metagenomic sequencing) and Ruminococcus torques and decreased Intestinibacter bartlettii at both 6 and 12 months and decreased the genus Roseburia, including R. faecis and R. intestinalis, at 12 months. Effects were similar in comparison of the metformin group with the behavioral weight loss group. Metformin versus control also increased butyrate, acetate, and valerate at 6 months (but not at 12 months). Behavioral weight loss versus control did not significantly alter microbiota composition but did increase acetate at 6 months (but not at 12 months). Increases in acetate were associated with decreases in fasting insulin. Additional whole-genome metagenomic sequencing of a subset of the metformin group showed that metformin altered 62 metagenomic functional pathways, including an acetate-producing pathway and three pathways in glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS Metformin, but not behavioral weight loss, impacted gut microbiota composition at 6 months and 12 months. Both metformin and behavioral weight loss altered circulating SCFAs at 6 months, including increasing acetate, which correlated with lower fasting insulin. Future research is needed to elucidate whether the gut microboime mediates or modifies metformin’s health effects.},

abstract = {Trillions of microorganisms inhabit the human gut and are regarded as potential key factors for health1,2. Characteristics such as diet, lifestyle, or genetics can shape the composition of the gut microbiota2–6 and are usually shared by individuals from comparable ethnic origin. So far, most studies assessing how ethnicity relates to the intestinal microbiota compared small groups living at separate geographical locations7–10. Using fecal 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in 2,084 participants of the Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) study11,12, we show that individuals living in the same city tend to share similar gut microbiota characteristics with others of their ethnic background. Ethnicity contributed to explain the interindividual dissimilarities in gut microbiota composition, with three main poles primarily characterized by operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as Prevotella (Moroccans, Turks, Ghanaians), Bacteroides (African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese), and Clostridiales (Dutch). The Dutch exhibited the greatest gut microbiota α-diversity and the South-Asian Surinamese the smallest, with corresponding enrichment or depletion in numerous OTUs. Ethnic differences in α-diversity and interindividual dissimilarities were independent of metabolic health and only partly explained by ethnic-related characteristics including sociodemographic, lifestyle, or diet factors. Hence, the ethnic origin of individuals may be an important factor to consider in microbiome research and its potential future applications in ethnic-diverse societies.Stool microbiota composition correlates with the ethnic backgrounds of people living in the same city, suggesting that geographical location and ethnicity have distinct effects on microbiota.},

abstract = {Physical activity (PA) at recommended levels contributes to the prevention of non-communicable diseases, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (asCVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since the composition of the gut microbiota is strongly intertwined with dietary intake, the specific effect of exercise on the gut microbiota is not known. Moreover, multiple other factors, such as ethnicity, influence the composition of the gut microbiota, and this may be derived by distinct diet as well as PA patterns. Here we aim to untangle the associations between PA and the gut microbiota in a sample (n = 1334) from the Healthy Life In an Urban Setting (HELIUS) multi-ethnic cohort. The associations of different food groups and gut microbiota were also analyzed. PA was monitored using subjective (n = 1309) and objective (n = 162) methods, and dietary intake was assessed with ethnic-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The gut microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the functional composition was generated with the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2). Associations were assessed using multivariable and machine learning models. In this cohort, a distinct gut microbiota composition was associated with meeting the Dutch PA norm as well as with dietary intake, e.g., grains. PA related parameters such as muscle strength and calf circumference correlated with gut microbiota diversity. Furthermore, gut microbial functionality differed between active and sedentary groups. Differential representation of ethnicities in active and sedentary groups in both monitor methods hampered the detection of ethnic-specific effects. In conclusion, both PA and dietary intake were associated with gut microbiota composition in our multi-ethnic cohort. Future studies should further elucidate the role of ethnicity and diet in this association.},

abstract = {AIMS
The metabolic derangements in type 2 diabetes have been attributed to compositional changes in the gut microbiota. Metformin, the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, has been found to modulate the gut microbiota. However, no literature has reported the associations between the composition of the gut microbiota and glycemic durability to metformin monotherapy.


METHODS
A total of 375 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited, among which 14 and 11 patients were eligible as the metformin durable group and nondurable group, respectively. Fecal samples were collected to analyze the gut microbiota by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and PICRUSt2 was adopted to infer microbial functional differences.


RESULTS
Although the two groups had similar biochemical profiles and microbial metabolites, the pattern of microbiota clustering was different. The intra-group diversity was significantly reduced in the durable group. For the microbial metabolic pathways, the biosynthesis of thiamine and lipopolysaccharide was dominant in the durable group.


CONCLUSIONS
There were different compositions of gut microbiota with unique microbial metabolic pathways between type 2 diabetes with and without glycemic durability to metformin monotherapy. Microbial salvage by increasing thiamine biosynthesis might be beneficial for the metformin durable group to maintain optimal glycemic control.},

abstract = {Background The human gut microbiota exhibits marked variation around the world, which has been attributed to dietary intake and other environmental factors. However, the degree to which ethnicity-associated differences in gut microbial community structure and function are maintained following immigration or in the context of metabolic disease is poorly understood. Results We conducted a multi-omic study of 46 lean and obese East Asian and White participants living in the San Francisco Bay Area. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant differences between ethnic groups in bacterial richness and community structure. White individuals were enriched for the mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila. East Asian participants had increased levels of multiple bacterial phyla, fermentative pathways detected by metagenomics, and the short-chain fatty acid end products acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. Differences in the gut microbiota between the East Asian and White groups could not be explained by reported dietary intake, were more pronounced in lean individuals, and were associated with current geographical location. Microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice confirmed that the differences in the gut microbiota of the East Asian and White individuals we analyzed are independent of diet and that they differentially impact host body weight and adiposity in genetically identical mouse recipients. Conclusions The reported findings emphasize the utility of studying diverse ethnic groups within a defined geographical location and provide a starting point for dissecting the mechanisms contributing to the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and ethnicity-associated lifestyle, demographic, metabolic, and genetic factors.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesisIndividuals with type 2 diabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota. However, recent studies suggest that metformin alters the composition and functional potential of gut microbiota, thereby interfering with the diabetes-related microbial signatures. We tested whether specific gut microbiota profiles are associated with prediabetes (defined as fasting plasma glucose of 6.1–7.0 mmol/l or HbA1c of 42–48 mmol/mol [6.0–6.5%]) and a range of clinical biomarkers of poor metabolic health.MethodsIn the present case–control study, we analysed the gut microbiota of 134 Danish adults with prediabetes, overweight, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and low-grade inflammation and 134 age- and sex-matched individuals with normal glucose regulation.ResultsWe found that five bacterial genera and 36 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were differentially abundant between individuals with prediabetes and those with normal glucose regulation. At the genus level, the abundance of Clostridium was decreased (mean log2 fold change −0.64 (SEM 0.23), padj = 0.0497), whereas the abundances of Dorea, [Ruminococcus], Sutterella and Streptococcus were increased (mean log2 fold change 0.51 (SEM 0.12), padj = 5 × 10−4; 0.51 (SEM 0.11), padj = 1 × 10−4; 0.60 (SEM 0.21), padj = 0.0497; and 0.92 (SEM 0.21), padj = 4 × 10−4, respectively). The two OTUs that differed the most were a member of the order Clostridiales (OTU 146564) and Akkermansia muciniphila, which both displayed lower abundance among individuals with prediabetes (mean log2 fold change −1.74 (SEM 0.41), padj = 2 × 10−3 and −1.65 (SEM 0.34), padj = 4 × 10−4, respectively). Faecal transfer from donors with prediabetes or screen-detected, drug-naive type 2 diabetes to germfree Swiss Webster or conventional C57BL/6 J mice did not induce impaired glucose regulation in recipient mice.Conclusions/interpretationCollectively, our data show that individuals with prediabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota characterised by a decreased abundance of the genus Clostridium and the mucin-degrading bacterium A. muciniphila. Our findings are comparable to observations in overt chronic diseases characterised by low-grade inflammation.},

abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to rapidly mutate and change in ways that impact virulence, transmissibility, and immune evasion. Genome sequencing is a critical tool, as other biological techniques can be more costly, time-consuming, and difficult. However, the rapid and complex evolution of SARS-CoV-2 challenges conventional sequence analysis methods like phylogenetic analysis. The virus picks up and loses mutations independently in multiple subclades, often in novel or unexpected combinations, and, as for the newly emerged Omicron variant, sometimes with long explained branches. We propose interpretable deep sequence models trained by machine learning to complement conventional methods. We apply Transformer-based neural network models developed for natural language processing to analyze protein sequences. We add network layers to generate sample embeddings and sequence-wide attention to interpret models and visualize multiscale patterns. We demonstrate and validate our framework by modeling SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus taxonomy. We then develop an interpretable predictive model of disease severity that integrates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence and patient demographic variables, using publicly available data from the GISAID database. We also apply our model to Omicron. Based on knowledge prior to the availability of empirical data for Omicron, we predict: 1) reduced neutralization antibody activity (15-50 fold) greater than any previously characterized variant, varying between Omicron sublineages, and 2) reduced risk of severe disease (by 35-40%) relative to Delta. Both predictions are in accord with recent epidemiological and experimental data.},

abstract = {Delta variant has rapidly become the predominant pandemic driver and yielded four subvariants (delta1, delta2, delta3 and delta4). Among them, delta1 has been mainly responsible for the latest COVID-19 waves in India, Southeast Asia, Europe and the USA. A relevant question is how delta subvariants may have driven the pandemic in the rest of the world. In both Israel and Qatar, mRNA-based vaccination has been rolled out competitively, but the outcomes are quite different in terms of controlling the recent waves resulting from delta variant. This raises the question whether delta subvariants have acted differently in Israel and Qatar. In both countries, delta variant was first identified in April 2021 and delta1 subvariant constituted ~50% delta genomes from April to May 2021. But the situation started to diverge in June 2021: In Israel, delta1 variant was encoded by 92.0% delta genomes, whereas this fraction was only 43.9% in Qatar. Moreover, a delta1 sublineage encoding spike T791I was identified in Israel but not Qatar. This sublineage accounted for 31.8% delta genomes sequenced in June 2021 and declined to 13.3% in October 2021. In August 2021, delta1 also became dominant in Qatar and a major sublineage encoding spike D1259H emerged. This sublineage has evolved further and acquired additional spike substitutions, including K97E, S255F, I693S, I712S, I1104L, E1258D and/or V1177I, in Qatar and other countries, such as Czech Republic, France and Mexico. Monthly distribution of the above sublineages suggests that the one from Qatar is much more of concern than that from Israel. Different from what was in Israel and Qatar, delta2 subvariant has also been important in Bahrain, whereas a delta2 sublineage encoding spike V1264L and A1736V of NSP3 was dominant in June 2021, but was gradually taken over by delta1 subvariant. These results suggest that delta1 and delta2 subvariants continue their evolution in different countries. The recent successful pandemic control in Israel, Qatar and Bahrain supports that delta1 and delta2 subvariants are still sensitive to timed vaccination, thereby urging the use of optimal immunity as a strategy to block SARS-COV-2 evolution and control the pandemic.},

abstract = {Inferring causal effects is critically important in biomedical research as it allows us to move from the typical paradigm of associational studies to causal inference, and can impact treatments and therapeutics. Association patterns can be coincidental and may lead to wrong inferences in complex systems. Microbiomes are highly complex, diverse, and dynamic environments. Microbes are key players in health and diseases. Hence knowledge of genuine causal relationships among the entities in a microbiome, and the impact of internal and external factors on microbial abundance and interactions are essential for understanding disease mechanisms and making treatment recommendations. In this paper, we investigate fundamental causal inference techniques to measure the causal effects of various entities in a microbiome. In particular, we show how to use these techniques on microbiome datasets to study the rise and impact of antibiotic-resistance in microbiomes. Our main contributions include the following. We introduce a novel pipeline for microbiome studies, new ideas for experimental design under weaker assumptions, and data augmentation by context embedding. Our pipeline is robust, different from traditional approaches, and able to predict interventional effects without any controlled experiments. Our work shows the advantages of causal inference in identifying potential pathogenic, beneficial, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We validate our results using results that were previously published.},

abstract = {Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic multi-symptomatic illness that is associated with fatigue, pain, cognitive deficits, and gastrointestinal disturbances and presents a significant challenge to treat in clinics. Our previous studies show a role of an altered Gut–Brain axis pathology in disease development and symptom persistence in GWI. The present study utilizes a mouse model of GWI to study the role of a labdane diterpenoid andrographolide (AG) to attenuate the Gut–Brain axis-linked pathology. Results showed that AG treatment in mice (100 mg/kg) via oral gavage restored bacteriome alterations, significantly increased probiotic bacteria Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae, and Bifidobacterium, the genera that are known to aid in preserving gut and immune health. AG also corrected an altered virome with significant decreases in virome families Siphoviridae and Myoviridae known to be associated with gastrointestinal pathology. AG treatment significantly restored tight junction proteins that correlated well with decreased intestinal proinflammatory mediators IL-1β and IL-6 release. AG treatment could restore Claudin-5 levels, crucial for maintaining the BBB integrity. Notably, AG could decrease microglial activation and increase neurotrophic factor BDNF, the key to neurogenesis. Mechanistically, microglial conditioned medium generated from IL-6 stimulation with or without AG in a concentration similar to circulating levels found in the GWI mouse model and co-incubated with neuronal cells in vitro, decreased Tau phosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis. In conclusion, we show that AG treatment mitigated the Gut–Brain-Axis associated pathology in GWI and may be considered as a potential therapeutic avenue for the much-needed bench to bedside strategies in GWI.},

Environmental and genetic factors also act as a second hit to modulate severity and are expected to enhance the NAFLD-linked neuropathology. Using a mouse model of NAFLD, exposed to microcystin subsequent to the onset of fatty liver, we show that the cyanotoxin could significantly increase proinflammatory cytokine expression in the frontal cortex and cause increased expression of Lcn2 and HMGB1. The above effects were NLRP3 inflammasome activation-dependent since the use of NLRP3 knockout mice abrogated the increase in inflammation. NLRP3 was also responsible for decreased expression of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin 5 suggesting BBB dysfunction was parallel to neuroinflammation following microcystin exposure. An increased circulatory S100B release, a hallmark of astrocyte activation in microcystin exposed NAFLD mice also confirmed BBB integrity loss, but the astrocyte activation observed in vivo was NLRP3 independent suggesting an important role of a secondary S100B mediated crosstalk. Mechanistically, conditioned medium from reactive astrocytes and parallel S100B incubation in neuronal cells caused increased inducible NOS, COX-2, and higher BAX/ Bcl2 protein expression suggesting oxidative stress-mediated neuronal cell apoptosis crucial for neurodegeneration. Taken together, microcystin exacerbated neuronal NAFLD-linked comorbidities leading to cortical inflammation, BBB dysfunction, and neuronal apoptosis.},
