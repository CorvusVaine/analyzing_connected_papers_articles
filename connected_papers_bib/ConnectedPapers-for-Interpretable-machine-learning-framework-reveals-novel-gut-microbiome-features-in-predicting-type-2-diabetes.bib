abstract = {Gut microbiome targets for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention among human cohorts have been controversial. Using an interpretable machine learning-based analytic framework, we identified robust human gut microbiome features, with their optimal threshold, in predicting T2D. Based on the results, we constructed a microbiome risk score (MRS), which was consistently associated with T2D across 3 independent Chinese cohorts involving 9111 participants (926 T2D cases). The MRS could also predict future glucose increment, and was correlated with a variety of gut microbiota-derived blood metabolites. Faecal microbiota transplantation from humans to germ-free mice demonstrated a causal role of the identified combination of microbes in the T2D development. We further identified adiposity and dietary factors which could prospectively modulate the MRS, and found that body fat distribution may be the key factor modulating the gut microbiome-T2D relationship. Taken together, we proposed a new analytical framework for the investigation of microbiome-disease relationship. The identified microbiota may serve as potential drug targets for T2D in future.},

abstract = {Background Little is known about the interplay among dairy intake, gut microbiota and cardiometabolic health in human prospective cohort studies. Methods The present study included 1780 participants from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study. We examined the prospective association between habitual dairy consumption (total dairy, milk, yogurt) and gut microbial composition using linear regression after adjusting for socio-demographic, lifestyle and dietary factors. The cross-sectional association of dairy-associated microbial features with cardiometabolic risk factors was examined with a linear regression model, adjusting for potential confounders. Serum metabolomic profiles were analyzed by partial correlation analysis. Findings There was a significant overall difference in gut microbial community structure (β-diversity) comparing the highest with the lowest category for each of total dairy, milk and yogurt (P < 0.05). We observed that dairy-associated microbes and α-diversity indices were inversely associated with blood triglycerides, while positively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A follow-up metabolomics analysis revealed the association of targeted serum metabolites with dairy-microbial features and cardiometabolic traits. Specifically, 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid and L-alanine were inversely associated with dairy-microbial score, while positively associated with triglycerides (FDR-corrected P < 0.1). Interpretation Dairy consumption is associated with the gut microbial composition and a higher α-diversity, which provides new insights into the understanding of dairy-gut microbiota interactions and their relationship with cardiometabolic health.

abstract = {(1) Background: Individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease display gut dysbiosis when compared to healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether there is a change in dysbiosis across the stages of diabetic chronic kidney disease. We investigated a cross-sectional study of patients with early and late diabetes associated chronic kidney disease to identify possible microbial differences between these two groups and across each of the stages of diabetic chronic kidney disease. (2) Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 95 adults. DNA extracted from collected stool samples were used for 16S rRNA sequencing to identify the bacterial community in the gut. (3) Results: The phylum Firmicutes was the most abundant and its mean relative abundance was similar in the early and late chronic kidney disease group, 45.99 ± 0.58% and 49.39 ± 0.55%, respectively. The mean relative abundance for family Bacteroidaceae, was also similar in the early and late group, 29.15 ± 2.02% and 29.16 ± 1.70%, respectively. The lower abundance of Prevotellaceae remained similar across both the early 3.87 ± 1.66% and late 3.36 ± 0.98% diabetic chronic kidney disease groups. (4) Conclusions: The data arising from our cohort of individuals with diabetes associated chronic kidney disease show a predominance of phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The families Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroidaceae represent the highest abundance, while the beneficial Prevotellaceae family were reduced in abundance. The most interesting observation is that the relative abundance of these gut microbes does not change across the early and late stages of diabetic chronic kidney disease, suggesting that this is an early event in the development of diabetes associated chronic kidney disease. We hypothesise that the dysbiotic microbiome acquired during the early stages of diabetic chronic kidney disease remains relatively stable and is only one of many risk factors that influence progressive kidney dysfunction.},

abstract = {Like humans, outbred Sprague-Dawley CD rats exhibit a polygenic pattern of inheritance of the obese phenotype and not all individuals exposed to a high calorie intake develop obesity. We hypothesized that differences in gut microbiota composition account for phenotype differences between obese prone (OP) and obese resistant (OR) rats. We studied the gut microbiota composition of OPand OR rats after a high fat (HF) diet and how they respond to fermentation of resistant starch (RS). In phase 1 of the study 28 OP and 28 OR rats were fed a HF diet. In order to determine causal role of microbiota on phenotypes, In phase 2, a microbiota transplant between the two phenotypes was performed before switching all rats to a HF diet supplemented with 20% RS. We determined microbiota composition by 16S sequencing and predicted microbiota function by PICRUSt2. Despite a similar calorie intake, in phase 2 OP rats gained more weight and accumulated more abdominal fat in both phase 1 and 2 compared to OR rats (P < 0.001; n = 6). The OP rats fermented RS more robustly compared with OR rats with an increase in total bacteria, short chain fatty acids, and increased weight of the cecum, but microbiota of OP rats had much lower alpha diversity and evenness. The microbiota of OP rats, had higher amounts of bacteria from order Bacteroidales, specifically family Muribaculaceae (S24-7), which is known to possess several starch degrading enzymes and was reported in previous studies to increase with fermentation of RS. The OR rats fermented RS less but had higher bacterial diversity and evenness and had significantly higher bacterial counts from phylum Firmicutes particularly order Clostridiales, genus Clostridium and an uncultured bacterium of the genus Akkermansia. The microbiota of OR rats had enhanced bacterial chemotaxis, phosphotransferase system (PTS), and fatty acid biosynthesis compared to OP rats whose microbiota had higher glycan degradation and LPS biosynthesis pathways. The microbiota transplant did not change obesity phenotype or microbiota composition. In conclusion, a higher alpha-diversity and evenness of the microbiota and higher proportions of Clostridiales and Akkermansia in OR rats were associated with a better metabolic phenotype with lower body fat. However, robust RS fermentation caused a lower diversity and evenness and did not result in a leaner phenotype.},

abstract = {The aim of this review is to cover the current and future possibilities and challenges of using the gut microbiota, with its capacity to be modified, in the development of preventive and treatment strategies for hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes in humans. The totality of microbial genomes in the gut exceeds the size of the human genome, having around 500-fold more genes that importantly complement our coding potential. Microbial genes are essential for key metabolic processes, such as the breakdown of indigestible dietary fibres to short-chain fatty acids, biosynthesis of amino acids and vitamins, and production of neurotransmitters and hormones. During the last decade, evidence has accumulated to support a role for gut microbiota (analysed from faecal samples) in glycaemic control and type 2 diabetes. Mechanistic studies in mice support a causal role for gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, although human data favouring causality is insufficient. As it may be challenging to sort the human evidence from the large number of animal studies in the field, there is a need to provide a review of human studies. Thus, the aim of this review is to cover the current and future possibilities and challenges of using the gut microbiota, with its capacity to be modified, in the development of preventive and treatment strategies for hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes in humans. We discuss what is known about the composition and functionality of human gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes and summarise recent evidence of current treatment strategies that involve, or are based on, modification of gut microbiota (diet, probiotics, metformin and bariatric surgery). We go on to review some potential future gut-based glucose-lowering approaches involving microbiota, including the development of personalised nutrition and probiotic approaches, identification of therapeutic components of probiotics, targeted delivery of propionate in the proximal colon, targeted delivery of metformin in the lower gut, faecal microbiota transplantation, and the incorporation of genetically modified bacteria that express therapeutic factors into microbiota. Finally, future avenues and challenges for understanding the interplay between human nutrition, genetics and microbial genetics, and the need for integration of human multi-omic data (such as genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics and metabolomics) with microbiome data (such as strain-level variation, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) to make personalised treatments a successful future reality are discussed.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prospective association of fruit and vegetable intake with human gut microbiota and to examine the relationship between fruit and vegetable-related gut microbiota and their related metabolites with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. This study included 1879 middle-age elderly Chinese adults from Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study (GNHS). Baseline dietary information was collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire (2008–2013). Fecal samples were collected at follow-up (2015–2019) and analyzed for 16S rRNA sequencing and targeted fecal metabolomics. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin. We used multivariable linear regression and logistic regression models to investigate the prospective associations of fruit and vegetable intake with gut microbiota and the association of the identified gut microbiota (fruit/vegetable-microbiota index) and their related fecal metabolites with T2D risk, respectively. Replications were performed in an independent cohort involving 6626 participants. In the GNHS, dietary fruit intake, but not vegetable, was prospectively associated with gut microbiota diversity and composition. The fruit-microbiota index (FMI, created from 31 identified microbial features) was positively associated with fruit intake (p < 0.001) and inversely associated with T2D risk (odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95%CI 0.71–0.97). The FMI-fruit association (p = 0.003) and the FMI-T2D association (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.84–0.97) were both successfully replicated in the independent cohort. The FMI-positive associated metabolite sebacic acid was inversely associated with T2D risk (OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.51–0.86). The FMI-negative associated metabolites cholic acid (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13–1.62), 3-dehydrocholic acid (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.09–1.54), oleylcarnitine (OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.45–2.20), linoleylcarnitine (OR 1.66, 95%CI 1.37–2.05), palmitoylcarnitine (OR 1.62, 95%CI 1.33–2.02), and 2-hydroglutaric acid (OR 1.47, 95%CI 1.25–1.72) were positively associated with T2D risk. Higher fruit intake-associated gut microbiota and metabolic alteration were associated with a lower risk of T2D, supporting the public dietary recommendation of adopting high fruit intake for the T2D prevention.},

abstract = {Background Gut microbiome has recently been identified as a new potential risk factor in addition to well-known diabetes risk factors. The aim of this study was to analyze the differences in the composition of gut microbiome in prediabetes(PreDM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-diabetic controls. Methods A total of 180 participants were recruited for this study: 60 with T2DM, 60 with PreDM and 60 non-diabetics (control group). Fecal samples were collected from the participants and genomic DNA was extracted. The composition and diversity of gut microbiome were investigated in fecal DNA samples using Illumina sequencing of the V3∼V4 regions of 16sRNA. Results There were significant differences in the number of bacteria among patients with PreDM and T2DM and the control group. Compared with the control group, Proteobacteria bacteria were significantly higher in the PreDM group (P = 0.006). On the genus level, Compared with the control group, the relative abundance of Prevotella and Alloprevotella was significantly higher in the T2DM group (P = 0.016, P = 0.018), and the relative abundance of Paraprevotella in T2DM and PreDM groups was lower than that in the control group (P = 0.011, P = 0.045). Compared with the PreDM group and the control group, the relative abundance of Bacteroides in the T2DM group was significantly lower (P = 0.019, P = 0.002). Conclusions The present study found significant differences in the gut microbiome between PreDM, T2DM and non-diabetic individuals, specifically at the genus level, suggesting that early intervention in PreDM patients could have implications for gut flora transitioning to T2DM. In addition, these results may be valuable for developing strategies to control T2DM by modifying the gut microbiome.},

However, studies comparing the microbiome characteristics between T2DM and healthy controls have reported inconsistent results.

Using a random effects model and a fixed effects model, we observed significant differences in beta diversity, but not alpha diversity, between individuals with T2DM and controls. We identified various operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) and bacterial genera with significant odds ratios for T2DM. The T2DM signatures derived from a single study by stepwise feature selection could be applied in other studies. By training on multiple studies, we improved the detection accuracy and disease specificity for T2DM. We also discuss the relationship between T2DM-enriched or T2DM-depleted genera and probiotics and provide new ideas for diabetes prevention and improvement.},

abstract = {Background The study was conducted to investigate the effects of metformin treatment on the human gut microbiome’s taxonomic and functional profile in the Latvian population, and to evaluate the correlation of these changes with therapeutic efficacy and tolerance. Methods In this longitudinal observational study, stool samples for shotgun metagenomic sequencing-based analysis were collected in two cohorts. The first cohort included 35 healthy nondiabetic individuals (metformin dose 2x850mg/day) at three time-points during metformin administration. The second cohort was composed of 50 newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients (metformin dose–determined by an endocrinologist) at two concordant times. Patients were defined as Responders if their HbA1c levels during three months of metformin therapy had decreased by ≥12.6 mmol/mol (1%), while in Non-responders HbA1c were decreased by <12.6 mmol/mol (1%). Results Metformin reduced the alpha diversity of microbiota in healthy controls (p = 0.02) but not in T2D patients. At the species level, reduction in the abundance of Clostridium bartlettii and Barnesiella intestinihominis, as well as an increase in the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis and Oscillibacter unclassified overlapped between both study groups. A large number of group-specific changes in taxonomic and functional profiles was observed. We identified an increased abundance of Prevotella copri (FDR = 0.01) in the Non-Responders subgroup, and enrichment of Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Odoribacter, and Dialister at baseline in the Responders group. Various taxonomic units were associated with the observed incidence of side effects in both cohorts. Conclusions Metformin effects are different in T2D patients and healthy individuals. Therapy induced changes in the composition of gut microbiome revealed possible mediators of observed short-term therapeutic effects. The baseline composition of the gut microbiome may influence metformin therapy efficacy and tolerance in T2D patients and could be used as a powerful prediction tool.},

The gut microbiome is mainly shaped by diet, and varies across geographical regions. Little is known about the longitudinal association of gut microbiota with glycaemic control. We aimed to identify gut microbiota prospectively associated with glycaemic traits and type 2 diabetes in a geographically diverse population, and examined the cross-sectional association of dietary or lifestyle factors with the identified gut microbiota. The China Health and Nutrition Survey is a population-based longitudinal cohort covering 15 provinces/megacities across China. Of the participants in that study, 2772 diabetes-free participants with a gut microbiota profile based on 16S rRNA analysis were included in the present study (age 50.8 ± 12.7 years, mean ± SD). Using a multivariable-adjusted linear mixed-effects model, we examined the prospective association of gut microbiota with glycaemic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR). We constructed a healthy microbiome index (HMI), and used Poisson regression to examine the relationship between the HMI and incident type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the association of dietary or lifestyle factors with the glycaemic trait-related gut microbiota using a multivariable-adjusted linear regression model. After follow-up for 3 years, 123 incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified. We identified 25 gut microbial genera positively or inversely associated with glycaemic traits. The newly created HMI (per SD unit) was inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes (risk ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58, 0.84). Furthermore, we found that several microbial genera that were favourable for the glycaemic trait were consistently associated with healthy dietary habits (higher consumption of vegetable, fruit, fish and nuts). Our results revealed multiple gut microbiota prospectively associated with glycaemic traits and type 2 diabetes in a geographically diverse population, and highlighted the potential of gut microbiota-based diagnosis or therapy for type 2 diabetes.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown a clear link between gut microbiota and type 2 diabetes. However, current results are based on cross-sectional studies that aim to determine the microbial dysbiosis when the disease is already prevalent. ABSTRACT The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been increasing globally, and a growing body of evidence links type 2 diabetes with altered microbiota composition. Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long prediabetic state characterized by changes in various metabolic parameters. We tested whether the gut microbiome could have predictive potential for T2D development during the healthy and prediabetic disease stages. We used prospective data of 608 well-phenotyped Finnish men collected from the population-based Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study to build machine learning models for predicting continuous glucose and insulin measures in a shorter (1.5 year) and longer (4 year) period. Our results show that the inclusion of the gut microbiome improves prediction accuracy for modeling T2D-associated parameters such as glycosylated hemoglobin and insulin measures. We identified novel microbial biomarkers and described their effects on the predictions using interpretable machine learning techniques, which revealed complex linear and nonlinear associations. Additionally, the modeling strategy carried out allowed us to compare the stability of model performance and biomarker selection, also revealing differences in short-term and long-term predictions. The identified microbiome biomarkers provide a predictive measure for various metabolic traits related to T2D, thus providing an additional parameter for personal risk assessment. Our work also highlights the need for robust modeling strategies and the value of interpretable machine learning. IMPORTANCE Recent studies have shown a clear link between gut microbiota and type 2 diabetes. However, current results are based on cross-sectional studies that aim to determine the microbial dysbiosis when the disease is already prevalent. In order to consider the microbiome as a factor in disease risk assessment, prospective studies are needed. Our study is the first study that assesses the gut microbiome as a predictive measure for several type 2 diabetes-associated parameters in a longitudinal study setting. Our results revealed a number of novel microbial biomarkers that can improve the prediction accuracy for continuous insulin measures and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. These results make the prospect of using the microbiome in personalized medicine promising.},

Changes in the intestinal ecosystem could cause inflammation, alter intestinal permeability, and modulate metabolism of bile acids, short-chain fatty acids and metabolites that act synergistically on metabolic regulation systems contributing to insulin resistance. Interventions that restore equilibrium in the gut appear to have beneficial effects and improve glycemic control. Future research should examine in detail and in larger studies other possible pathophysiological mechanisms to identify specific pathways modulated by microbiota modulation and identify new potential therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Background The gut microbiome may play a role in inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) development. This cross-sectional study examined its relation with glycemic status within a subset of the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and estimated the association of circulating bacterial endotoxin (measured as plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)) with T2D, which may be mediated by C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods In 2013–16, cohort members from five ethnic groups completed clinic visits, questionnaires, and stool and blood collections. Participants with self-reported T2D and/or taking medication were considered T2D cases. Those with fasting glucose >125 and 100–125 mg/dL were classified as undiagnosed (UT2D) and pre-diabetes (PT2D) cases, respectively. We characterized the gut microbiome through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and measured plasma LBP and CRP by standard assays. Linear regression was applied to estimate associations of the gut microbiome community structure and LBP with T2D status adjusting for relevant confounders. Results Among 1,702 participants (59.9–77.4 years), 735 (43%) were normoglycemic (NG), 506 (30%) PT2D, 154 (9%) UT2D, and 307 (18%) T2D. The Shannon diversity index decreased (ptrend = 0.05), while endotoxin, measured as LBP, increased (ptrend = 0.0003) from NG to T2D. Of 10 phyla, Actinobacteria (ptrend = 0.007), Firmicutes (ptrend = 0.003), and Synergistetes (ptrend = 0.02) were inversely associated and Lentisphaerae (ptrend = 0.01) was positively associated with T2D status. Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Lachnospira, and Peptostreptococcaceae were less, while Escherichia-Shigella and Lachnospiraceae were more abundant among T2D patients, but the associations with Actinobacteria, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, and Escherichia-Shigella may be due metformin use. PT2D/UT2D values were closer to NG than T2D. No indication was detected that CRP mediated the association of LBP with T2D. Conclusions T2D but not PT2D/UT2D status was associated with lower abundance of SCFA-producing genera and a higher abundance of gram-negative endotoxin-producing bacteria suggesting that the gut microbiome may contribute to chronic systemic inflammation and T2D through bacterial translocation.},

abstract = {Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanidhydrochloride) is widely used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is the most prescribed antidiabetic drug in the USA. Metformin has been shown to inhibit liver glucose production, regulate peripheral glucose uptake in both liver and skeletal muscle, and increase insulin sensitivity. Even though metformin is thought tohave an anti-hyperglycemic effect bysuppressing the hepatic glucose output through activation of adenosinemonophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) dependent and AMPK independent pathways in the liver, studies reveal that it may also act through pathways in the intestine. Microbiota-mediated effects of metformin, which are claimed to be the cause of both therapeutic and adverse effects and the mechanisms of these effects have been investigated based on currentarticles on the subject. Zuluaga et al., in their study, aimed to test the effect of metformin on T2DM and intestinal dysbiosis relationship on Colombian adults in line with previous observations (34).Their study provides evidence compatible with the hypothesis that metformin has direct effects on the gut microbiota composition, by increasing mucin-degrading A. muciniphila , as well as various SCFA-producing bacteria(34). The study conducted by Wu H et al. is among the first studies showing that there is a link between metformin and metal binding proteins produced by intestinal microbiota (35). Study data show that metformin interacts with different gut bacteria, possibly through regulation of metal homeostasis (35). The findings support the idea that altered gut microbiota mediates the antidiabetic effects of metformin (35).},

This systematic review summarised the latest findings on differential composition of gut microbiota in T2DM.


METHODS
Literature search was performed using electronic databases. Relevant studies were identified, extracted and assessed for risk of bias. The primary outcome of this systematic review was the composition of gut microbiota in healthy controls and T2DM while the secondary outcomes included the correlation of gut microbiota with metabolic parameters.


RESULTS
Thirteen case-control studies involving 575 T2DM and 840 healthy controls were included. T2DM patients exhibited a marked increase in lactobacilli. Six studies found lactobacilli to predominate the gut of T2DM patients; however, this could be confounded by the types of antihyperglyacemic medications. Conversely, butyrate producers dominate the gut of healthy controls. In T2DM patients, butyrate producers were surprisingly higher in those taking metformin intake than those not taking the drug. Whilst lactobacilli were found to be higher with increased plasma glucose, conflicting correlations were observed between various genera and anthropometric measurements, dietary intake, lipid profiles and inflammatory markers. There were moderate to strong significant positive correlations between the class Clostridia and phylum Firmicutes with pro-inflammatory IFN-γ as well as between Negativicutes and IL-6.


CONCLUSIONS
Altogether, butyrate-producing bacteria are negatively correlated to glycaemic parameters. Lactobacilli are higher in T2DM patients and Firmicutes is correlated with inflammation.},

abstract = {Background: There is paucity of information on the gut microbiota compositions of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) subjects in South East of Nigeria, with Next-Generation Sequencing technology (NGS). Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with metabolic disorders, such as obesity, insulin resistance and T2DM. The objectives of this study are to determine gut microbiome compositions in T2DM individuals and healthy controls and to predict bacterial metabolic functional gene variations. Methods: Stool samples were collected from 110 confirmed T2DM and 10 non-T2DM subjects and bacterial DNA extracted. The V4 regions of bacterial 16S rRNA were amplified and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. The raw pair-end FASTQ sequence files were imported into EzBioCloud pipeline and Illumina BaseSpace for taxonomic identification. Results: The species richness or alpha diversity were lower in T2DM subjects when compared with the healthy controls. Similar trend was observed in phylogenetic diversity and Shannon index. Firmicutes (63.21% vs 64.89%) were the most abundant in the gut of both T2DM and healthy controls, followed by Bacteroidetes (18.46% vs 22.35%), Proteobacteria (12.77% vs 6.93%), and Cyanobacteria (2.24% vs 1.71%). There was significant lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Romboutsia timonensis, Blautia coccoides and others as a marker in T2D patients than healthy controls. The relative abundance of Bacteriodes vulgatus, Prevotella copri were significantly higher (p< 0.05) among T2DM subjects than Non-T2DM subjects. Lactobacillus mucosae, L. salivarius and Lactococcus lactis were significantly higher in T2DM subjects. Over 156 metabolic functional genes were significantly downregulated in T2DM subjects, and bacterial gene ortholog K20890xylan alpha-glucuronosyltransferase involved in the metabolism of non-digestible fibre was turned off in T2DM patients. Conclusion: The high abundance of Prevotella copri and low abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in T2DM represents intestinal pathobionts signatures associated with T2DM development. Butyrate and propionate-producing bacteria found in lower abundance in T2DM offer support for dietary or probiotics intervention.},

abstract = {Abstract The theory of ominous octet proposed by Dr. Defronzo in 2008 has emphasized the underlying complicated pathogenesis mechanism in type 2 diabetes. Recently it was further identified that gut microbiota dysbiosis is also closely related to development of chronic inflammations related diseases including diabetes. Diabetes is characterized by "leaky gut" syndrome where bacterial cell wall components enter the blood circulation of animal host in a higher amount. These may cause metabolic endotoxemia and systemic low-grade inflammation, affecting vital organs related to the ominous octet. On the other hand, the bacterial metabolites also systemically affect glucose homeostasis and energy utilization. The effects of current clinically available oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) are related to altering the compositions of gut microbiota, among which metformin are the most extensively explored. Gut microbiota therefore play an important role as a functional cross-bridge between host environment and the ominous octet, modulating diabetes. With continuing explorations, in the future gut microbiota may serve as a diagnostic biomarker in personalized medicine. Its modulation may also be used as a novel approach to treat type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Purpose Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an urgent public health problem and disproportionately affects Mexican Americans. The gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes; however, no studies have examined this association in Mexican-Americans. The objective of this study was to compare gut microbiome composition between Mexican-Americans with and without T2DM. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of volunteers from San Antonio, TX. Subjects were 18 years or older and self-identified as Mexican American. Subjects were grouped by prior T2DM diagnosis. Eligible subjects attended a clinic visit to provide demographic and medical information. Thereafter, subjects recorded their dietary intake for three days and collected a stool sample on the fourth day. Stool 16s rRNA sequences were classified into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) via the mothur bayesian classifier and referenced to the Greengenes database. Shannon diversity and bacterial taxa relative abundance were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Beta diversity was estimated using Bray-Curtis indices and compared between groups using PERMANOVA. Results Thirty-seven subjects were included, 14 (38%) with diabetes and 23 (62%) without diabetes. Groups were well-matched by body mass index and comorbid conditions. Shannon diversity was not significantly different between those with and without T2DM (3.26 vs. 3.31; p = 0.341). Beta diversity was not significantly associated with T2DM diagnosis (p = 0.201). The relative abundance of the most common bacterial phyla and families did not significantly differ between groups; however, 16 OTUs were significantly different between groups. Conclusions Although alpha diversity was not significantly different between diabetic and non-diabetic Mexican Americans, the abundance of certain bacterial taxa were significantly different between groups.},

However, the mechanism underlying the progression from central obesity to T2D remains unknown. Therefore, we analyzed the gut microbial profiles of central obese individuals with or without T2D from a Chinese population. Here we reported both the microbial compositional and gene functional alterations during the progression from central obesity to T2D. Several opportunistic pathogens were enriched in obese T2D patients. We also characterized thousands of genes involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism whose abundance were significantly depleted in obese T2D group. Moreover, the abundance of those genes was negatively associated with plasma glycemia level and percentage of individuals with impaired plasma glucose status. Therefore, our study indicates that the abundance of those depleted genes can be used as a potential biomarker to identify central obese individuals with high risks of developing T2D.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a prevalent non-communicable disease among the world's growing elderly population. The contribution of the gut microbiota to T2D in several Westernized countries has been established. However, there is little information on the role of the gut microbiota in T2D from the African continent where lifestyle and life expectancy are different. Aims This study sought to investigate gut microbiota variation in relation to elderly people living with T2D. in Nigeria. Methods Whole microbial community DNA were derived from the stool samples of healthy urban-dwelling elderly individuals and urban-dwelling elderly individuals with T2D. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was Illumina-sequenced and analyzed using QIIME2. Results Beta taxonomic diversity was significantly different between healthy elderly individuals and elderly individuals with T2D. However, no difference in the alpha taxonomic diversity and predicted functional alpha diversity of the gut microbiota was observed. The genus Ruminococcus (T2D versus Healthy: 2.89% vs 2.21%), families Coriobacteriaceae (Collinsella, T2D versus Healthy: 2.62 % vs 1.25%) and Bifidobacteriaceae were enriched in elderly individuals with T2D, while members of Clostridiaceae (Clostridium, Healthy versus T2D: 5.6% vs 3.2%) and Peptostreptococcaceae (Healthy versus T2D: 3.45% vs 1.99%) were enriched in healthy volunteers. Pathways involved in amino acid biosynthesis were enriched in elderly individuals with T2D, while pathways involved in respiration and the biosynthesis of vital building blocks were enriched in healthy volunteers. Conclusions The study demonstrated for the first time in an African elderly population that the abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae, Collinsella, and Ruminococcus within the gut varies in relation to T2D. Findings from this study suggest that the restoration of features associated with healthiness via the way of gut microbiota modification could be one step needed to improve elderly patient care.},

abstract = {Low concordance between studies that examine the role of microbiota in human diseases is a pervasive challenge that limits the capacity to identify causal relationships between host-associated microorganisms and pathology. The risk of obtaining false positives is exacerbated by wide interindividual heterogeneity in microbiota composition 1 , probably due to population-wide differences in human lifestyle and physiological variables 2 that exert differential effects on the microbiota. Here we infer the greatest, generalized sources of heterogeneity in human gut microbiota profiles and also identify human lifestyle and physiological characteristics that, if not evenly matched between cases and controls, confound microbiota analyses to produce spurious microbial associations with human diseases. We identify alcohol consumption frequency and bowel movement quality as unexpectedly strong sources of gut microbiota variance that differ in distribution between healthy participants and participants with a disease and that can confound study designs. We demonstrate that for numerous prevalent, high-burden human diseases, matching cases and controls for confounding variables reduces observed differences in the microbiota and the incidence of spurious associations. On this basis, we present a list of host variables that we recommend should be captured in human microbiota studies for the purpose of matching comparison groups, which we anticipate will increase robustness and reproducibility in resolving the members of the gut microbiota that are truly associated with human disease. The authors use a machine-learning approach to uncover confounding variables in studies that seek to establish an association between the gut microbiota and human disease.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesisIndividuals with type 2 diabetes have an altered bacterial composition of their gut microbiota compared with non-diabetic individuals. However, these alterations may be confounded by medication, notably the blood-glucose-lowering biguanide, metformin. We undertook a clinical trial in healthy and previously drug-free men with the primary aim of investigating metformin-induced compositional changes in the non-diabetic state. A secondary aim was to examine whether the pre-treatment gut microbiota was related to gastrointestinal adverse effects during metformin treatment.MethodsTwenty-seven healthy young Danish men were included in an 18-week one-armed crossover trial consisting of a pre-intervention period, an intervention period and a post-intervention period, each period lasting 6 weeks. Inclusion criteria were men of age 18–35 years, BMI between 18.5 kg/m2 and 27.5 kg/m2, HbA1c < 39 mmol/mol (5.7%) and plasma creatinine within the normal range. No prescribed medication, including antibiotics, for 2 months prior to recruitment were allowed and no previous gastrointestinal surgery, discounting appendectomy or chronic illness requiring medical treatment. During the intervention the participants were given metformin up to 1 g twice daily. Participants were examined five times in the fasting state with blood sampling and recording of gastrointestinal symptoms. Examinations took place at Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark before and after the pre-intervention period, halfway through and immediately after the end of intervention and after the wash-out period. Faecal samples were collected at nine evenly distributed time points, and bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in order to evaluate gut microbiota composition. Subjective gastrointestinal symptoms were reported at each visit.ResultsData from participants who completed visit 1 (n=23) are included in analyses. For the primary outcome the relative abundance of 11 bacterial genera significantly changed during the intervention but returned to baseline levels after treatment cessation. In line with previous reports, we observed a reduced abundance of Intestinibacter spp. and Clostridium spp., as well as an increased abundance of Escherichia/Shigella spp. and Bilophila wadsworthia. The relative abundance at baseline of 12 bacterial genera predicted self-reported gastrointestinal adverse effects.Conclusions/interpretationIntake of metformin changes the gut microbiota composition in normoglycaemic young men. The microbiota changes induced by metformin extend and validate previous reports in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Secondary analyses suggest that pre-treatment gut microbiota composition may be a determinant for development of gastrointestinal adverse effects following metformin intake.

The aim of the current study was firstly a cross-sectional comparison of the GM of diabetic cats, to that of lean, and of obese/overweight non-diabetic cats of a similar age. Specifically, fecal samples from 82 privately-owned cats from Denmark and Switzerland were sequenced using 16S rRNA gene amplicon metabarcoding. Secondly dietary intervention data was generated, by obtaining additional samples from a subset of cats after placing them on a high-protein diet for four weeks. The GM diversity of diabetic cats was lower than that of lean cats in the cross-sectional study, and lower compared to lean and to overweight/obese cats after diet intervention. Diabetic cats also exhibited fewer Anaerotruncus, Dialister, and unknown Ruminococcaceae than lean cats. Serum fructosamine levels correlated negatively with Prevotellaceae abundance and positively with Enterobacteriaceae abundance. In summary the intestinal microbiota of diabetic cats was characterized by decreased GM diversity and loss of butyrate producing bacterial genera.},

abstract = {AIMS
The metabolic derangements in type 2 diabetes have been attributed to compositional changes in the gut microbiota. Metformin, the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, has been found to modulate the gut microbiota. However, no literature has reported the associations between the composition of the gut microbiota and glycemic durability to metformin monotherapy.


METHODS
A total of 375 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited, among which 14 and 11 patients were eligible as the metformin durable group and nondurable group, respectively. Fecal samples were collected to analyze the gut microbiota by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and PICRUSt2 was adopted to infer microbial functional differences.


RESULTS
Although the two groups had similar biochemical profiles and microbial metabolites, the pattern of microbiota clustering was different. The intra-group diversity was significantly reduced in the durable group. For the microbial metabolic pathways, the biosynthesis of thiamine and lipopolysaccharide was dominant in the durable group.


CONCLUSIONS
There were different compositions of gut microbiota with unique microbial metabolic pathways between type 2 diabetes with and without glycemic durability to metformin monotherapy. Microbial salvage by increasing thiamine biosynthesis might be beneficial for the metformin durable group to maintain optimal glycemic control.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To identify the core gut microbial features associated with type 2 diabetes risk and potential demographic, adiposity, and dietary factors associated with these features. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used an interpretable machine learning framework to identify the type 2 diabetes–related gut microbiome features in the cross-sectional analyses of three Chinese cohorts: one discovery cohort (n = 1,832, 270 cases of type 2 diabetes) and two validation cohorts (cohort 1: n = 203, 48 cases; cohort 2: n = 7,009, 608 cases). We constructed a microbiome risk score (MRS) with the identified features. We examined the prospective association of the MRS with glucose increment in 249 participants without type 2 diabetes and assessed the correlation between the MRS and host blood metabolites (n = 1,016). We transferred human fecal samples with different MRS levels to germ-free mice to confirm the MRS–type 2 diabetes relationship. We then examined the prospective association of demographic, adiposity, and dietary factors with the MRS (n = 1,832). RESULTS The MRS (including 14 microbial features) consistently associated with type 2 diabetes, with risk ratio for per 1-unit change in MRS 1.28 (95% CI 1.23–1.33), 1.23 (1.13–1.34), and 1.12 (1.06–1.18) across three cohorts. The MRS was positively associated with future glucose increment (P < 0.05) and was correlated with a variety of gut microbiota–derived blood metabolites. Animal study further confirmed the MRS–type 2 diabetes relationship. Body fat distribution was found to be a key factor modulating the gut microbiome–type 2 diabetes relationship. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal a core set of gut microbiome features associated with type 2 diabetes risk and future glucose increment.},

abstract = {Objective Mounting evidence has suggested a link between gut microbiome characteristics and type 2 diabetes (T2D). To determine whether these alterations occur before the impairment of glucose regulation, we characterize gut microbiota in normoglycemic individuals who go on to develop T2D. Methods We designed a nested case-control study, and enrolled individuals with a similar living environment. A total of 341 normoglycemic individuals were followed for 4 years, including 30 who developed T2D, 33 who developed prediabetes, and their matched controls. Fecal samples (developed T2D, developed prediabetes and controls: n=30, 33, and 63, respectively) collected at baseline underwent metagenomics sequencing. Results Compared with matched controls, individuals who went on to develop T2D had lower abundances of Bifidobacterium longum, Coprobacillus unclassified, and Veillonella dispar and higher abundances of Roseburia hominis, Porphyromonas bennonis, and Paraprevotella unclassified. The abundance of Bifidobacterium longum was negatively correlated with follow-up blood glucose levels. Moreover, the microbial Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, methane metabolism, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and membrane transport were changed between the two groups. Conclusions We found that fecal microbiota of healthy individuals who go on to develop T2D had already changed when they still were normoglycemic. These alterations of fecal microbiota might provide insights into the development of T2D and a new perspective for identifying individuals at risk of developing T2D.},

abstract = {Recognizing and treating the early stages of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most cost effective way to decrease prevalence, before heart disease, renal disease, blindness, and limb amputation become inevitable. In this study, we employ high resolution gut microbiome metatranscriptomic analysis of stool samples from 53,970 individuals to identify predictive biomarkers of type 2 diabetes progression and potential for diagnosis and treatment response. The richness of the metatranscriptomic data enabled us to develop a T2D risk model to delineate individuals with glycemic dysregulation from those within normal glucose levels, with ROC-AUC of 0.83+/-0.04. This risk score can predict the probability of having insulin dysregulation before detecting high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), the standard-of-care marker for prediabetes and diabetes. Additionally, a machine learning model was able to distinguish novel metatranscriptomic features that segregate patients who receive metformin and are able to control their HbA1c from those who do not. These discoveries set the stage for developing multiple therapeutic avenues for prevention and treatment of T2D.},

abstract = {The ratio of human to bacterial cells in the human body (microbiota) is around 1:1. As a result of co-evolution of the host mucosal immune system and the microbiota, both have developed multiple mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. However, dissociations between the composition of the gut microbiota and the human host may play a crucial role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Metformin, the most frequently administered medication to treat patients with type 2 diabetes, has only recently been suggested to alter gut microbiota composition through the increase in mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila, as well as several SCFA-producing (short-chain fatty acid) microbiota. The gut microbiota of participants on metformin has exerted alterations in gut metabolomics with increased ability to produce butyrate and propionate, substances involved in glucose homeostasis. Thus, metformin appears to affect the microbiome, and an individual’s metformin tolerance or intolerance may be influenced by their microbiome. In this review, we will focus on the effects of metformin in gut microbiota among patients with T2DM.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesisIndividuals with type 2 diabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota. However, recent studies suggest that metformin alters the composition and functional potential of gut microbiota, thereby interfering with the diabetes-related microbial signatures. We tested whether specific gut microbiota profiles are associated with prediabetes (defined as fasting plasma glucose of 6.1–7.0 mmol/l or HbA1c of 42–48 mmol/mol [6.0–6.5%]) and a range of clinical biomarkers of poor metabolic health.MethodsIn the present case–control study, we analysed the gut microbiota of 134 Danish adults with prediabetes, overweight, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and low-grade inflammation and 134 age- and sex-matched individuals with normal glucose regulation.ResultsWe found that five bacterial genera and 36 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were differentially abundant between individuals with prediabetes and those with normal glucose regulation. At the genus level, the abundance of Clostridium was decreased (mean log2 fold change −0.64 (SEM 0.23), padj = 0.0497), whereas the abundances of Dorea, [Ruminococcus], Sutterella and Streptococcus were increased (mean log2 fold change 0.51 (SEM 0.12), padj = 5 × 10−4; 0.51 (SEM 0.11), padj = 1 × 10−4; 0.60 (SEM 0.21), padj = 0.0497; and 0.92 (SEM 0.21), padj = 4 × 10−4, respectively). The two OTUs that differed the most were a member of the order Clostridiales (OTU 146564) and Akkermansia muciniphila, which both displayed lower abundance among individuals with prediabetes (mean log2 fold change −1.74 (SEM 0.41), padj = 2 × 10−3 and −1.65 (SEM 0.34), padj = 4 × 10−4, respectively). Faecal transfer from donors with prediabetes or screen-detected, drug-naive type 2 diabetes to germfree Swiss Webster or conventional C57BL/6 J mice did not induce impaired glucose regulation in recipient mice.Conclusions/interpretationCollectively, our data show that individuals with prediabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota characterised by a decreased abundance of the genus Clostridium and the mucin-degrading bacterium A. muciniphila. Our findings are comparable to observations in overt chronic diseases characterised by low-grade inflammation.},

abstract = {Microbiota-host-diet interactions contribute to the development of metabolic diseases. Imidazole propionate is a novel microbially produced metabolite from histidine, which impairs glucose metabolism. Here, we show that subjects with prediabetes and diabetes in the MetaCardis cohort from three European countries have elevated serum imidazole propionate levels. Furthermore, imidazole propionate levels were increased in subjects with low bacterial gene richness and Bacteroides 2 enterotype, which have previously been associated with obesity. The Bacteroides 2 enterotype was also associated with increased abundance of the genes involved in imidazole propionate biosynthesis from dietary histidine. Since patients and controls did not differ in their histidine dietary intake, the elevated levels of imidazole propionate in type 2 diabetes likely reflects altered microbial metabolism of histidine, rather than histidine intake per se. Thus the microbiota may contribute to type 2 diabetes by generating imidazole propionate that can modulate host inflammation and metabolism.},

The objective of this pilot study was to understand the association of gut microbiome and neratinib-induced diarrhea. Twenty-five patients (age ≥ 60) were enrolled in a phase II trial evaluating safety and tolerability of neratinib in older adults with HER2+ breast cancer (NCT02673398). Fifty stool samples were collected from 11 patients at baseline and during treatment. 16S rRNA analysis was performed and relative abundance data were generated. Shannon’s diversity was calculated to examine gut microbiome dysbiosis. An explainable tree-based approach was utilized to classify patients who might experience neratinib-related diarrhea (grade ≥ 1) based on pre-treatment baseline microbial relative abundance data. The hold-out Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic and Area Under Precision-Recall Curves of the model were 0.88 and 0.95, respectively. Model explanations showed that patients with a larger relative abundance of Ruminiclostridium 9 and Bacteroides sp. HPS0048 may have reduced risk of neratinib-related diarrhea and was confirmed by Kruskal-Wallis test (p ≤ 0.05, uncorrected). Our machine learning model identified microbiota associated with reduced risk of neratinib-induced diarrhea and the result from this pilot study will be further verified in a larger study.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Recent studies suggest the beneficial effects of metformin on glucose metabolism may be microbially mediated. We examined the association of type 2 diabetes, metformin, and gut microbiota in community-dwelling Colombian adults. On the basis of previous research, we hypothesized that metformin is associated with higher levels of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)–producing and mucin-degrading microbiota. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were selected from a larger cohort of 459 participants. The present analyses focus on the 28 participants diagnosed with diabetes—14 taking metformin— and the 84 participants without diabetes who were matched (3-to-1) to participants with diabetes by sex, age, and BMI. We measured demographic information, anthropometry, and blood biochemical parameters and collected fecal samples from which we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the composition and structure of the gut microbiota. RESULTS We found an association between diabetes and gut microbiota that was modified by metformin use. Compared with participants without diabetes, participants with diabetes taking metformin had higher relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a microbiota known for mucin degradation, and several gut microbiota known for production of SCFAs, including Butyrivibrio, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Megasphaera, and an operational taxonomic unit of Prevotella. In contrast, compared with participants without diabetes, participants with diabetes not taking metformin had higher relative abundance of Clostridiaceae 02d06 and a distinct operational taxonomic unit of Prevotella and a lower abundance of Enterococcus casseliflavus. CONCLUSIONS Our results support the hypothesis that metformin shifts gut microbiota composition through the enrichment of mucin-degrading A. muciniphila as well as several SCFA-producing microbiota. Future studies are needed to determine if these shifts mediate metformin’s glycemic and anti-inflammatory properties.},

In addition, the abundance of several butyrate producers and functional potential for butyrate production were decreased both in prediabetes and T2D groups.

abstract = {The totality of microbial genomes in the gut exceeds the size of the human genome, having around 500-fold more genes that importantly complement our coding potential. Microbial genes are essential for key metabolic processes, such as the breakdown of indigestible dietary fibres to short-chain fatty acids, biosynthesis of amino acids and vitamins, and production of neurotransmitters and hormones. During the last decade, evidence has accumulated to support a role for gut microbiota (analysed from faecal samples) in glycaemic control and type 2 diabetes. Mechanistic studies in mice support a causal role for gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, although human data favouring causality is insufficient. As it may be challenging to sort the human evidence from the large number of animal studies in the field, there is a need to provide a review of human studies. Thus, the aim of this review is to cover the current and future possibilities and challenges of using the gut microbiota, with its capacity to be modified, in the development of preventive and treatment strategies for hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes in humans. We discuss what is known about the composition and functionality of human gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes and summarise recent evidence of current treatment strategies that involve, or are based on, modification of gut microbiota (diet, probiotics, metformin and bariatric surgery). We go on to review some potential future gut-based glucose-lowering approaches involving microbiota, including the development of personalised nutrition and probiotic approaches, identification of therapeutic components of probiotics, targeted delivery of propionate in the proximal colon, targeted delivery of metformin in the lower gut, faecal microbiota transplantation, and the incorporation of genetically modified bacteria that express therapeutic factors into microbiota. Finally, future avenues and challenges for understanding the interplay between human nutrition, genetics and microbial genetics, and the need for integration of human multi-omic data (such as genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics and metabolomics) with microbiome data (such as strain-level variation, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) to make personalised treatments a successful future reality are discussed.},

abstract = {Human gut microbiota is a complex community of organisms including trillions of bacteria. While these microorganisms are considered as essential regulators of our immune system, some of them can cause several diseases. In recent years, next-generation sequencing technologies accelerated the discovery of human gut microbiota. In this respect, the use of machine learning techniques became popular to analyze disease-associated metagenomics datasets. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease and affects millions of people around the world. Since the early diagnosis in T2D is important for effective treatment, there is an utmost need to develop a classification technique that can accelerate T2D diagnosis. In this study, using T2D-associated metagenomics data, we aim to develop a classification model to facilitate T2D diagnosis and to discover T2D-associated biomarkers. The sequencing data of T2D patients and healthy individuals were taken from a metagenome-wide association study and categorized into disease states. The sequencing reads were assigned to taxa, and the identified species are used to train and test our model. To deal with the high dimensionality of features, we applied robust feature selection algorithms such as Conditional Mutual Information Maximization, Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy, Correlation Based Feature Selection, and select K best approach. To test the performance of the classification based on the features that are selected by different methods, we used random forest classifier with 100-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation. In our experiments, we observed that 15 commonly selected features have a considerable effect in terms of minimizing the microbiota used for the diagnosis of T2D and thus reducing the time and cost. When we perform biological validation of these identified species, we found that some of them are known as related to T2D development mechanisms and we identified additional species as potential biomarkers. Additionally, we attempted to find the subgroups of T2D patients using k-means clustering. In summary, this study utilizes several supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to increase the diagnostic accuracy of T2D, investigates potential biomarkers of T2D, and finds out which subset of microbiota is more informative than other taxa by applying state-of-the art feature selection methods.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
Obesity is a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes; however, up to 20% of patients are normal weight. Our aim was to identify metabolite patterns reproducibly predictive of BMI and subsequently to test whether lean individuals who carry an obese metabolome are at hidden high risk of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Levels of 108 metabolites were measured in plasma samples of 7,663 individuals from two Swedish and one Italian population-based cohort. Ridge regression was used to predict BMI using the metabolites. Individuals with a predicted BMI either >5 kg/m2 higher (overestimated) or lower (underestimated) than their actual BMI were characterized as outliers and further investigated for obesity-related risk factors and future risk of type 2 diabetes and mortality.


RESULTS
The metabolome could predict BMI in all cohorts (r2 = 0.48, 0.26, and 0.19). The overestimated group had a BMI similar to individuals correctly predicted as normal weight, had a similar waist circumference, were not more likely to change weight over time, but had a two times higher risk of future type 2 diabetes and an 80% increased risk of all-cause mortality. These associations remained after adjustments for obesity-related risk factors and lifestyle parameters.


CONCLUSIONS
We found that lean individuals with an obesity-related metabolome have an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and all-cause mortality compared with lean individuals with a healthy metabolome. Metabolomics may be used to identify hidden high-risk individuals to initiate lifestyle and pharmacological interventions.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential link between glucose control, intestinal permeability, diet and intestinal microbiota in patients with T2D. Thirty‐two males with well‐controlled T2D and 30 age‐matched male controls without diabetes were enrolled in a case–control study. Metabolic parameters, inflammatory markers, endotoxemia, and intestinal microbiota in individuals subdivided into high (HP) and normal (LP) colonic permeability groups, were the main outcomes. In T2D, the HP group had significantly higher fasting glucose (P = 0.034) and plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels (P = 0.049) compared with the LP group. Increased colonic permeability was also linked with altered abundances of selected microbial taxa. The microbiota of both T2D and control HP groups was enriched with Enterobacteriales. In conclusion, high intestinal permeability was associated with poorer fasting glucose control in T2D patients and changes in some microbial taxa in both T2D patients and nondiabetic controls. Therefore, enrichment in the gram‐negative order Enterobacteriales may characterize impaired colonic permeability prior to/independently from a disruption in glucose tolerance.},

abstract = {Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is considered a significant and increasing worldwide problem. The growing body of evidence on this topic has allowed us to point out that a hostile intrauterine environment in mothers with GDM via epigenetic mechanisms induces “diabetogenic” and “obesogenic” changes in an offspring’s DNA. This sets a vicious intergenerational cycle of metabolic diseases in motion, gradually deteriorating the health of the human population. One of the most important participants of this process seems to be altered microbiota. There is a chance that the identification of specific epigenetic marks may provide a key for future diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic solutions in the field of personalised medicine. Given the reversibility of most epigenetic changes, there is an opportunity to improve the long-term health of the human population. In this manuscript, we aim to summarise available data on epigenetic changes among women suffering from GDM and their progeny, in association with alterations in the microbiome.},

To examine the associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes from the large population-based UK Biobank cohort study.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A total of 67,789 individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and 24,311 with diabetes who had no CVD or cancer at baseline were included in the current study. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured at baseline. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality after 10-14 years.


RESULTS
After multivariable adjustment, higher serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly and nonlinearly associated with lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality among participants with prediabetes and diabetes (all P nonlinearity < 0.05). Compared with those in the lowest category of 25(OH)D levels (<25 nmol/L), participants with prediabetes in the highest category of 25(OH)D levels (≥75 nmol/L) had a significant association with lower risk of cardiovascular events (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.71-0.86), coronary heart disease (CHD) (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71-0.89), heart failure (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.54-0.81), stroke (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.61-0.93), CVD mortality (HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.32-0.59), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.58-0.75). Likewise, these associations with cardiovascular events, CHD, heart failure, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality were observed among participants with diabetes, except for stroke.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings highlight the importance of monitoring and correcting vitamin D deficiency in the prevention of CVD and mortality among adults with prediabetes and diabetes.},
