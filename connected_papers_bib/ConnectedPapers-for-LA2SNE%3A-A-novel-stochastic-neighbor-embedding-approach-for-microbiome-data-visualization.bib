abstract = {Visualization of large-scale data is the first step to acquire preliminary insight into complex biological data. In recent years, many statistical visualization methods have been designed to support data visualization. Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) is one of these efficient approaches, which uses the probabilistic distance to model differences among data points within the data space. SNE and its variants (e.g. t-SNE) have demonstrated superiority over other methods in exploring complex data. By using these methods, however, similar data points tend to group together, which prevents the identification of subtle differences. A good visualization method should not only present clear data structure, but distinguish subtle differences. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of SNE. The approach has three innovations: (1) we replaced the Gaussian distribution in SNE with a Laplacian distribution on both high dimensional space and low dimensional space. The Laplace distribution has wider tails than the Gaussian distribution, and thus it can be used to overcome the over-crowding problem noted in SNE and its variants. (2) We used a symmetric modification of Kullback-Leibler divergence measure as the objective function which provides more flexibility to the model. (3) We add a graph Laplacian regularization terms to the objective function which have an advantage to preserve the manifold structure among data points. Experiments on simulation data and human microbiome data indicate that it has better visualization performance than other methods in distinguishing crowding data points.},

abstract = {Recently, statistics and machine learning have been developed to identify functional or taxonomic features of environmental features or physiological status. Important proteins (or other functional and taxonomic entities) to environmental features can be potentially used as biosensors. A major challenge is how the distribution of protein and gene functions embodies the adaption of microbial communities across environments and host habitats. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization method for linear regression to adapt the challenge. The approach is inspired by local linear embedding (LLE) and we call it a manifold-constrained regularization for linear regression (McRe). The novel regularization procedure also has potential to be used in solving other linear systems. We demonstrate the efficiency and the performance of the approach in both simulation and real data.},

abstract = {In recent years, HMP has provided analytical insights into the human microbiome to gain better insights into its effects on human health. Applying insights for therapeutic and biotechnological applications requires researchers efficiently classify the vast amount of microbes which comprise the microbiome. Since these datasets are sparse and complex in nature, the application of dimensionality reduction algorithms is a popular way for extracting latent phylogenetic themes. We introduce an Augmented Barnes-Hut t-SNE method, which is both more efficient in processing time and sensitive to subtle albeit meaningful variations in microbial classifications based on 5 high-level anatomical regions. We demonstrate that our method not only separates the microbiome into these regions, but can further elucidate them into 18 separate sample sites. It is contended that this approach can accurately resolve phylogenetic themes at varying levels of granularity, and anticipate its application in other research domains where complex high-dimensional datasets are prevalent.},

abstract = {Microbial communities residing in the nose play important roles in human health and disease. We report marked differences in nasal microbiota between a rural community and an industrial setting located near a major urban city. Nasal samples were collected from 19 healthy male subjects: 9 samples from persons living in a rural village, and 10 samples from ceramic factory workers in a major industrial Egyptian city. The nasal microbiota in the rural sample had higher and distinct diversity compared with industrial samples from workers exposed to pollution daily. Taxonomic analysis of the sequences revealed five major phyla; among these phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria, revealing significant abundance variation by geographical location. For example, the rural group had a significant increase in representation of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (p = 0.004, p = 0.01, respectively) compared with the industrial group. However, the industrial group showed a significant increase in relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria (p = 0.02). The most predominant genera for the rural group were Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Alloiococcus, and Peptoniphilus. By contrast, the industrial group was dominated by Staphylococcus, Sphingomonas, and Moraxella. Environmental pollution might alter the nasal microbiome leading to an attendant disturbance in the microbiome community structure. The clinical and public health implications of these nasal microbiome variations by rural and industrialized geography warrant further research. This study contributes to our knowledge of the bacterial composition of nasal microbiome in rural and industrialized geographies, and informs public health, respiratory medicine, and occupational health scholarship.},

abstract = {Using metagenomics to detect the global structure of microbial community remains a significant challenge. The structure of a microbial community and its functions are complicated not only because of the complex interactions among microbes but also their complicate interacting with confounding environmental factors. Recently dimension reduction methods such as Principle component analysis, Non-negative matrix factorization and Canonical correlation analysis have been employed extensively to investigate the complex structure embedded in metagenomic profiles which summarize the abundance of functional or taxonomic categorizations in metagenomic studies. However, metagenomic profiles are not necessary to meet the "Assumption of Linearity" behind these methods. Therefore it is worth to investigate how nonlinear methods can be utilized in metagenomic studies. In this paper, a nonlinear manifold learning method- Isomap is used to visualize and analyze large-scale metagenomic profiles. Isomap was applied on a large-scale Pfam profile which are derived from 45 metagenomes in Global Ocean Sampling expedition. In our result, a novel nonlinear structure of protein families is identified and the relationships among the identified nonlinear components and environmental factors of global ocean are explored. The results indicate the strength of nonlinear methods in learning the complex microbial structure. With the coming of the huge number of new sequenced metagenomes, nonlinear methods like Isomap could be necessary complementary tools to current widely used methods.},

abstract = {Visualization is one of the most powerful means for understanding the structure of multidimensional data. One of the most popular visualization methods is the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) that maps high dimensional data into low dimensional space while preserving the data's topological structure. While the topographical visualization can reveal the intrinsic characteristics of the data, SOM often fails to correctly reflect the distances between the data on the low dimensional map, thus reducing the fidelity of the visualization. The limitation of SOM to mimic the data structure is partly due to its inflexible structure, where the reference vectors are fixed, usually in two dimensional grid. In this study, a variant of SOM, where the reference vector can flexibly move to reconstruct the distribution of high dimensional data and thus can provide more precise visualization, is proposed. The proposed Elastic Self-Organizing Maps (ESOM) can also be used as nearest neighbors classifiers. This brief paper explains the basic characteristics and evaluation of ESOM against some benchmark problems.},

abstract = {The direct “metagenomic” sequencing of genomic material from complex assemblages of bacteria, archaea, viruses and microeukaryotes has yielded new insights into the structure of microbial communities. For example, analysis of metagenomic data has revealed the existence of previously unknown microbial taxa whose spatial distributions are limited by environmental conditions, ecological competition, and dispersal mechanisms. However, differences in genotypes that might lead biologists to designate two microbes as taxonomically distinct need not necessarily imply differences in ecological function. Hence, there is a growing need for large-scale analysis of the distribution of microbial function across habitats. Here, we present a framework for investigating the biogeography of microbial function by analyzing the distribution of protein families inferred from environmental sequence data across a global collection of sites. We map over 6,000,000 protein sequences from unassembled reads from the Global Ocean Survey dataset to protein families, generating a protein family relative abundance matrix that describes the distribution of each protein family across sites. We then use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to approximate these protein family profiles as linear combinations of a small number of ecological components. Each component has a characteristic functional profile and site profile. Our approach identifies common functional signatures within several of the components. We use our method as a filter to estimate functional distance between sites, and find that an NMF-filtered measure of functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than a comparable PCA-filtered measure. We also find that functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than with geographic distance, in agreement with prior studies. We identify similar protein functions in several components and suggest that functional co-occurrence across metagenomic samples could lead to future methods for de-novo functional prediction. We conclude by discussing how NMF, and other dimension reduction methods, can help enable a macroscopic functional description of marine ecosystems.},

Model-driven methods are often complicated but give a generative mechanism of microbial community which is helpful in understanding the generating process of complex microbial ecology.

abstract = {Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) metagenomics is increasingly used to study the structure and functions of complex microbial ecosystems, both from the taxonomic and functional point of view. Gene inventories of otherwise uncultured microbial communities make the direct functional profiling of microbial communities possible. The concept of community aggregated trait has been adapted from environmental and plant functional ecology to the framework of microbial ecology. Community aggregated traits are quantified from WGS data by computing the abundance of relevant marker genes. They can be used to study key processes at the ecosystem level and correlate environmental factors and ecosystem functions. In this paper we propose a novel model based approach to infer combinations of aggregated traits characterizing specific ecosystemic metabolic processes. We formulate a model of these Combined Aggregated Functional Traits (CAFTs) accounting for a hierarchical structure of genes, which are associated on microbial genomes, further linked at the ecosystem level by complex co-occurrences or interactions. The model is completed with constraints specifically designed to exploit available genomic information, in order to favor biologically relevant CAFTs. The CAFTs structure, as well as their intensity in the ecosystem, is obtained by solving a constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem. We developed a multicriteria selection procedure for the number of CAFTs. We illustrated our method on the modelling of ecosystemic functional traits of fiber degradation by the human gut microbiota. We used 1408 samples of gene abundances from several high-throughput sequencing projects and found that four CAFTs only were needed to represent the fiber degradation potential. This data reduction highlighted biologically consistent functional patterns while providing a high quality preservation of the original data. Our method is generic and can be applied to other metabolic processes in the gut or in other ecosystems.},

Recent advances in sequencing technologies have made it feasible to perform large-scale studies of microbial communities, providing the tools necessary to begin to address this question [4], [5].

In recent years, it has also received increasing attention for classification and regression analysis. This study presented a t-SNE based classification approach for compositional microbiome data, which enabled us to build classifiers and classify new samples in the reduced dimensional space produced by t-SNE. The Aitchison distance was employed to modify the conditional probabilities in t-SNE to account for the compositionality of microbiome data. To classify a new sample, its low-dimensional features were obtained as the weighted mean vector of its nearest neighbors in the training set. Using the low-dimensional features as input, three commonly used machine learning algorithms, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT) were considered for classification tasks in this study. The proposed approach was applied to two disease-associated microbiome datasets, achieving better classification performance compared with the classifiers built in the original high-dimensional space. The analytic results also showed that t-SNE with Aitchison distance led to improvement of classification accuracy in both datasets. In conclusion, we have developed a t-SNE based classification approach that is suitable for compositional microbiome data and may also serve as a baseline for more complex classification models.},

The structure of a microbial community and its functions are complicated because of not only the complex interactions among microbes but also their interactions with confounding environmental factors. Recently dimension reduction methods have been employed extensively to investigate the complex structure embedded in metagenomic profiles which summarize the abundance of functional or taxonomic categorizations in metagenomic studies. However, metagenomic profiles are not necessary to meet the “Assumption of Linearity” behind these methods. Therefore it is worth to investigate whether nonlinear methods are appropriate methods which can be utilized in metagenomic analysis. In this paper, we compare the applications of several methods, including two linear methods (Principle component analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization) and a nonlinear manifold learning method-Isomap on visualizing and analyzing metagenomic profiles. These methods are applied and compared on a taxonomic profile from 33 human gut metagenomes and a large-scale Pfam profile which are derived from 45 metagenomes in Global Ocean Sampling expedition. We find that all three methods can discover interesting structures of the taxonomic profile from human gut. Furthermore, Isomap identified a novel nonlinear structure of protein families. The relationships among the identified nonlinear components and environmental factors of global ocean are explored. The results indicate that nonlinear methods could be a complementary technique to current linear methods in analyzing metagenomic dataset.},

abstract = {A primary goal of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was to provide a reference collection of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences collected from sites across the human body that would allow microbiologists to better associate changes in the microbiome with changes in health. The HMP Consortium has reported the structure and function of the human microbiome in 300 healthy adults at 18 body sites from a single time point. Using additional data collected over the course of 12–18 months, we used Dirichlet multinomial mixture models to partition the data into community types for each body site and made three important observations. First, there were strong associations between whether individuals had been breastfed as an infant, their gender, and their level of education with their community types at several body sites. Second, although the specific taxonomic compositions of the oral and gut microbiomes were different, the community types observed at these sites were predictive of each other. Finally, over the course of the sampling period, the community types from sites within the oral cavity were the least stable, whereas those in the vagina and gut were the most stable. Our results demonstrate that even with the considerable intra- and interpersonal variation in the human microbiome, this variation can be partitioned into community types that are predictive of each other and are probably the result of life-history characteristics. Understanding the diversity of community types and the mechanisms that result in an individual having a particular type or changing types, will allow us to use their community types to assess disease risk and to personalize therapies.},

Especially, Andersson and Bro's PARAFAC algorithm with non-negativity constraints (AB-PARAFAC-NC) provided the state-of-the-art NTF algorithm, which uses Bro and de Jong's non-negativity-constrained least squares with single right hand side (NLS/S-RHS). However, solving an NLS with multiple right hand sides (NLS/M-RHS) problem by multiple NLS/S-RHS problems is not recommended due to hidden redundant computation. In this paper, we propose an NTF algorithm based on alternating large-scale non-negativity-constrained least squares (NTF/ANLS) using NLS/M-RHS. In addition, we introduce an algorithm for the regularized NTF based on ANLS (RNTF/ANLS). Our experiments illustrate that our NTF algorithms outperform AB-PARAFAC-NC in terms of computing speed on several data sets we tested.},

abstract = {Metagenomic studies sequence DNA directly from environmental samples to explore the structure and function of complex microbial and viral communities. Individual, short pieces of sequenced DNA (“reads”) are classified into (putative) taxonomic or metabolic groups which are analyzed for patterns across samples. Analysis of such read matrices is at the core of using metagenomic data to make inferences about ecosystem structure and function. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a numerical technique for approximating high-dimensional data points as positive linear combinations of positive components. It is thus well suited to interpretation of observed samples as combinations of different components. We develop, test and apply an NMF-based framework to analyze metagenomic read matrices. In particular, we introduce a method for choosing NMF degree in the presence of overlap, and apply spectral-reordering techniques to NMF-based similarity matrices to aid visualization. We show that our method can robustly identify the appropriate degree and disentangle overlapping contributions using synthetic data sets. We then examine and discuss the NMF decomposition of a metabolic profile matrix extracted from 39 publicly available metagenomic samples, and identify canonical sample types, including one associated with coral ecosystems, one associated with highly saline ecosystems and others. We also identify specific associations between pathways and canonical environments, and explore how alternative choices of decompositions facilitate analysis of read matrices at a finer scale.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
The Mycoplasma pneumoniae(MP) and influenza virus are two common pathogens causing pediatric acute respiratory tract infection. Though emerging reports demonstrated imbalanced respiratory microbiota in respiratory infection, the respiratory microbiota differences between MP and influenza virus remained to be explored.


METHODS
We collected paired nasopharyngeal(NP) and oropharyngeal(OP) microbial samples from 165 children, including 40 patients with MP pneumonia, 66 patients with influenza virus infection and 59 age-matched healthy children.


RESULTS
The NP and OP microbial diversity decreased in MP infection and increased in influenza infection as compared to healthy children. The Staphylococcus dominated Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia(MPP) patients' NP microbiota while five representative patterns remained in influenza patients. In OP microbiota, Streptococcus significantly enriched in MPP group and decreased in Influenza group. Decision tree analysis indicated that Ralstonia and Acidobacteria could discriminate microbial samples in healthy (59/67), MP (35/38) and Influenza groups (55/60) with high accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
This study revealed that dominant bacterial structure in the airway was niche- and disease-specific. It could facilitate the stratification of respiratory microbial samples with different infectious agents.},

abstract = {Efficient Alternating Gradient-type Algorithms for the Approximate Non-negative Matrix Factorization Problem by Edward F. Gonzalez The approximate non-negative matrix factorization problem (ANMF) seeks to interpret a given set of non-negative data vectors, where the non-negativity is physically meaningful, through the extraction of a sufficiently small set of non-negative "features". Each data vector is then approximated by a non-negative composition of the extracted features. Mathematically, this process is equivalent to approximating a non-negative matrix A by the product of two non-negative matrices, i.e. A « WE, where W e 9ft and H e W, and where p is typically chosen to be significantly smaller than m and n. A standard approach for solving the ANMF problem is to use a alternating gradient-type algorithm that keeps the iterates strictly positive. Lee and Seung have proposed what is arguably the most popular of these alternating gradient approaches. In this study we propose several variations of this particular Lee and Seung algorithm with notably improved performance. One of the proposed algorithms optimizes the step-length parameter to achieve greater reduction in the objective function, while another uses different weights derived from the first order necessary conditions of the ANMF problem. The latter has exhibited better empirical performance than the former, while both perform better in practice than the original Lee and Seung algorithm. Theoretical questions concerning the convergence of these feasible alternating gradienttype algorithms have remained unresolved. Hence, from an optimization point of view, these approaches may be seen as unsatisfactory. Our research has contributed to solving these theoretical questions by proving that a class of these algorithms will converge to a continuum, and in specific cases, to a KKT point. These convergence results are applicable to multiple variations of the popular Lee and Seung algorithm. A low-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a given matrix A is an optimal approximation under the Frobenius norm whose fundamental subspaces are most relevant within the given measure. In this study we utilize these subspaces to produce a compact reformulation of the ANMF problem to a lower dimensional optimization problem. We introduce an alternating algorithmic approach for this reformulation that is extremely efficient and competitive when producing a low rank ANMF.},

These patterns may provide clues about the main biological processes associated to different physiological states.

We developed an on-line version of t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We apply t-SNE to the time series iteratively on a running window, and for each displacement of the window, we choose as the seed of the next embedding the final positions of the points obtained in the previous embedding. This process ensures consistency of the representation of slowly evolving patterns, while ensuring that the embedding at each step is optimally adapted to the current window. We apply this method to the song of the developing zebra finch, and we show that we are able to track multiple distinct syllables that are slowly emerging over multiple days, from babbling to the adult song stage.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Many practical pattern recognition problems require non-negativity constraints. For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space.


RESULTS
In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.

The relative performance of different computational methods for identifying CDS from whole-genome shotgun sequencing is not fully established. Results Here we present an automated benchmarking workflow, using synthetic shotgun sequencing reads for which we know the true CDS content of the underlying communities, to determine the relative performance (sensitivity, positive predictive value or PPV, and computational efficiency) of different metagenome analysis tools for extracting the CDS content of a microbial community. Assembly-based methods are limited by coverage depth, with poor sensitivity for CDS at < 5X depth of sequencing, but have excellent PPV. Mapping-based techniques are more sensitive at low coverage depths, but can struggle with PPV. We additionally describe an expectation maximization based iterative algorithmic approach which we show to successfully improve the PPV of a mapping based technique while retaining improved sensitivity and computational efficiency. Conclusion Our benchmarking approach reveals the trade-offs of assembly versus alignment-based approaches and the relative performance of specific implementations when one wishes to extract the protein coding capacity of microbial communities.},

In a nutshell, the idea is to transform input data to a suitable space where redundant dimensions are compressible. The structure of this method is very flexible which accommodates a series of variants along this line. In this paper, the data transformation is carried out by Laplacian eigenmaps and the dimension selection is fulfilled by l2/l1 norm. A Nesterov algorithm is proposed to solve the approximated SDR objective function. Experiments have been conducted on images from video sequences and protein structure data. It is evident that the SDR algorithm has subspace learning capability and may be applied to computer vision applications potentially.},
