abstract = {Longitudinal microbiome datasets are being generated with increasing regularity, and there is broad recognition that these studies are critical for unlocking the mechanisms through which the microbiome impacts human health and disease. Yet, there is a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data. To address this gap, we developed an open-source software package, MDITRE, which implements a new highly efficient method leveraging deep-learning technologies to derive human-interpretable rules that predict host status from longitudinal microbiome data. Using semi-synthetic and a large compendium of publicly available 16S rRNA amplicon and metagenomics sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that in almost all cases, MDITRE performs on par or better than popular uninterpretable machine learning methods, and orders-of-magnitude faster than the prior interpretable technique. MDITRE also provides a graphical user interface, which we show through use cases can readily derive biologically meaningful interpretations linking patterns of microbiome changes over time with host phenotypes.},

abstract = {Growing interest in understanding microbiota dynamics has motivated the development of different strategies to model microbiota time series data. However, all of them must tackle the fact that the available data are high-dimensional, posing strong statistical and computational challenges. In order to address this challenge, we propose a Dirichlet autoregressive model with time-varying parameters, which can be directly adapted to explain the effect of groups of taxa, thus reducing the number of parameters estimated by maximum likelihood. A strategy has been implemented which speeds up this estimation. The usefulness of the proposed model is illustrated by application to a case study.},

We show that CoPTR is more accurate than the current state-of-the-art, while also providing more PTR estimates overall. We further develop theory formalizing a biological interpretation for PTRs. Using a reference database of 2935 species, we applied CoPTR to a case-control study of 1304 metagenomic samples from 106 individuals with irritable bowel disease. We show that PTRs have high inter-individual variation, are only loosely correlated with relative abundances, and are associated with disease status. We conclude by demonstrating how PTRs can be combined with relative abundances and metabolomics to investigate their effect on the microbiome.

abstract = {The microbiome, which is inherently dynamic, plays essential roles in human physiology and its disruption has been implicated in numerous human diseases. Linking dynamic changes in the microbiome to the status of the human host is an important problem, which is complicated by limitations and complexities of the data. Model interpretability is key in the microbiome field, as practitioners seek to derive testable biological hypotheses from data or develop diagnostic tests that can be understood by clinicians. Interpretable structure must take into account domainspecific information key to biologists and clinicians including evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) and dynamic behavior of the microbiome. A Bayesian model was previously developed in the field, which uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference to learn human interpretable rules for classifying the status of the human host based on microbiome time-series data, but that approach is not scalable to increasingly large microbiome datasets being produced. We present a new fully-differentiable model that also learns human-interpretable rules for the same classification task, but in an end-to-end gradient-descent based framework. We validate the performance of our model on human microbiome data sets and demonstrate our approach has similar predictive performance to the fully Bayesian method, while running orders-of-magnitude faster and moreover learning a larger set of rules, thus providing additional biological insight into the effects of diet and environment on the microbiome.},

abstract = {Motivation Accumulating evidence has highlighted the importance of microbial interaction networks. Methods have been developed for estimating microbial interaction networks, of which the generalized Lotka-Volterra equation (gLVE)-based method can estimate a directed interaction network. The previous gLVE-based method for estimating microbial interaction networks did not consider time-varying interactions. Results In this study, we developed unsupervised learning based microbial interaction inference method using Bayesian estimation (Umibato), a method for estimating time-varying microbial interactions. The Umibato algorithm comprises Gaussian process regression (GPR) and a new Bayesian probabilistic model, the continuous-time regression hidden Markov model (CTRHMM). Growth rates are estimated by GPR, and interaction networks are estimated by CTRHMM. CTRHMM can estimate time-varying interaction networks using interaction states, which are defined as hidden variables. Umibato outperformed the existing methods on synthetic datasets. In addition, it yielded reasonable estimations in experiments on a mouse gut microbiota dataset, thus providing novel insights into the relationship between consumed diets and the gut microbiota.

abstract = {Dynamic changes in microbial communities play an important role in human health and disease. Specifically, deciphering how microbial species in a community interact with each other and their environment can elucidate mechanisms of disease, a problem typically investigated using tools from community ecology. Yet, such methods require measurements of absolute densities, whereas typical datasets only provide estimates of relative abundances. Here, we systematically investigate models of microbial dynamics in the simplex of relative abundances. We derive a new nonlinear dynamical system for microbial dynamics, termed “compositional” Lotka-Volterra (cLV), unifying approaches using generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) equations from community ecology and compositional data analysis. On three real datasets, we demonstrate that cLV recapitulates interactions between relative abundances implied by gLV. Moreover, we show that cLV is as accurate as gLV in forecasting microbial trajectories in terms of relative abundances. We further compare cLV to two other models of relative abundance dynamics motivated by common assumptions in the literature—a linear model in a log-ratio transformed space, and a linear model in the space of relative abundances—and provide evidence that cLV more accurately describes community trajectories over time. Finally, we investigate when information about direct effects can be recovered from relative data that naively provide information about only indirect effects. Our results suggest that strong effects may be recoverable from relative data, but more subtle effects are challenging to identify.},

abstract = {Immediately after birth, newborn babies experience rapid colonization by microorganisms from their mothers and the surrounding environment1. Diseases in childhood and later in life are potentially mediated by the perturbation of the colonization of the infant gut microbiota2. However, the effects of delivery via caesarean section on the earliest stages of the acquisition and development of the gut microbiota, during the neonatal period (≤1 month), remain controversial3,4. Here we report the disrupted transmission of maternal Bacteroides strains, and high-level colonization by opportunistic pathogens associated with the hospital environment (including Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Klebsiella species), in babies delivered by caesarean section. These effects were also seen, to a lesser extent, in vaginally delivered babies whose mothers underwent antibiotic prophylaxis and in babies who were not breastfed during the neonatal period. We applied longitudinal sampling and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic analysis to 1,679 gut microbiota samples (taken at several time points during the neonatal period, and in infancy) from 596 full-term babies born in UK hospitals; for a subset of these babies, we collected additional matched samples from mothers (175 mothers paired with 178 babies). This analysis demonstrates that the mode of delivery is a significant factor that affects the composition of the gut microbiota throughout the neonatal period, and into infancy. Matched large-scale culturing and whole-genome sequencing of over 800 bacterial strains from these babies identified virulence factors and clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance in opportunistic pathogens that may predispose individuals to opportunistic infections. Our findings highlight the critical role of the local environment in establishing the gut microbiota in very early life, and identify colonization with antimicrobial-resistance-containing opportunistic pathogens as a previously underappreciated risk factor in hospital births.Delivery via caesarean section, maternal antibiotic prophylaxis and colonization by opportunistic pathogens associated with the hospital environment affect the composition of the gut microbiota of children from birth until infancy.},

They found that both human and mouse gut microbiota dynamics can be characterized by several robust scaling laws describing short- and long-term changes in gut microbiota abundances, distributions of species residence and return times, and the correlation between the mean and the temporal variance of species abundances. They claimed that those scaling laws characterize both short- and long-term dynamics of gut microbiota. However, we are concerned that their interpretation is quite misleading, because all the scaling laws can be reproduced by the shuffled time series with completely randomized time stamps of the microbiome samples.},

abstract = {Human microbial communities are associated with many human diseases such as obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. High-throughput sequencing technology has been widely used to profile the microbial communities in order to understand their impact on human health. In the first part of this dissertation, we analyzed fecal samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing from a prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease patients, who started therapy with enteral nutrition or anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. The results reveal the full complement and dynamics of bacteria and fungi during treatment. Bacterial community membership was associated independently with dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and therapy. Motivated by the problems in real data analysis, this dissertation also presents two novel statistical models for microbiome data analysis. One important aspect of metagenomic data analysis is to quantify the bacterial abundances based on the sequencing data. In order to account for certain systematic differences in read coverage along the genome, we propose a multi-sample Poisson model to quantify microbial abundances based on read counts that are assigned to species-specific taxonomic markers. Our model takes into account the marker-specific effects when normalizing the sequencing count data in order to obtain more accurate quantification of the species abundances. Another statistical model we proposed is for longitudinal microbiome data analysis. A key question in longitudinal microbiome studies is to identify the microbes that are associated with clinical outcomes or environmental factors. We develop a zero-inflated Beta regression model with random effects for testing the association between microbial abundance and clinical covariates for longitudinal microbiome data. The model includes a logistic regression component to model presence/absence of a microbe in samples and a Beta regression component to model non-zero microbial abundance, where each component includes a random effect to take into account the correlations among repeated measurements on the same subject. The statistical methods were evaluated using simulations as well as the real data from Penn microbiome study of pediatric Crohn's disease.

abstract = {Cranberry consumption has numerous health benefits, with experimental reports showing its anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties. Importantly, microbiome research has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal bacterial community modulates host immunity, raising the question whether the cranberry-derived effect may be related to its ability to modulate the microbiome. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of cranberry products on the microbiome to date. Especially because cranberry is rich in dietary fibers, we do not know the extent of microbiome modulation that is caused solely by polyphenols, particularly proanthocyanidins (PACs). Since previous work has only focused on the long-term effects of cranberry extracts, in this study we investigated the effect of a water-soluble, polyphenol-rich cranberry juice extract (CJE) on the short-term dynamics of human-derived bacterial community in a gnotobiotic mouse model. CJE characterization revealed a high enrichment in PACs (57% PACs), the highest ever utilized in a microbiome study. In a 37-day experiment with a 10-day CJE intervention and 14-day recovery time, we profiled the microbiota via 16 rDNA sequencing and applied diverse time-series analytics methods to identify individual bacterial responses. We show that daily administration of CJE induces distinct dynamical patterns in bacterial abundances during and after treatment before recovering resiliently to pre-treatment levels. Specifically, we observed an increase of the immunomodulatory mucin degrading Akkermansia muciniphila after treatment, suggesting intestinal mucus accumulation due to CJE. Interestingly, this expansion coincided with an increase in the abundance of butyrate-producing Clostridia, a group of microbes known to promote numerous adaptive and innate anti-inflammatory phenotypes.},

abstract = {Preterm infants face health problems likely related to microbial exposures, including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. However, the role of the gut microbiome in preterm infant health is poorly understood. Microbial colonization differs from that of healthy term babies because it occurs in the NICU and is often perturbed by antibiotics. We measured bacterial compositions and metabolomic profiles of 77 fecal samples from 32 preterm infants to investigate the differences between microbiomes in health and disease. Rather than finding microbial signatures of disease, we found that both the preterm infant microbiome and the metabolome were personalized and that the preterm infant gut microbiome is enriched in microbes that commonly dominate in the presence of antibiotics. These results contribute to the growing knowledge of the preterm infant microbiome and emphasize that a personalized view will be important to disentangle the health consequences of the preterm infant microbiome. ABSTRACT The assembly and development of the gut microbiome in infants have important consequences for immediate and long-term health. Preterm infants represent an abnormal case for bacterial colonization because of early exposure to bacteria and frequent use of antibiotics. To better understand the assembly of the gut microbiota in preterm infants, fecal samples were collected from 32 very low birth weight preterm infants over the first 6 weeks of life. Infant health outcomes included health, late-onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We characterized bacterial compositions by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomes by untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Preterm infant fecal samples lacked beneficial Bifidobacterium spp. and were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus organisms due to nearly uniform antibiotic administration. Most of the variance between the microbial community compositions could be attributed to the baby from which the sample derived (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA] R2 = 0.48, P < 0.001), while clinical status (health, NEC, or late-onset sepsis) and overlapping times in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) did not explain a significant amount of variation in bacterial composition. Fecal metabolomes were also found to be unique to the individual (PERMANOVA R2 = 0.43, P < 0.001) and weakly associated with bacterial composition (Mantel statistic r = 0.23 ± 0.05, P < 0.05). No measured metabolites were found to be associated with necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, or a healthy outcome. Overall, preterm infant gut microbial communities were personalized and reflected antibiotic usage. IMPORTANCE Preterm infants face health problems likely related to microbial exposures, including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. However, the role of the gut microbiome in preterm infant health is poorly understood. Microbial colonization differs from that of healthy term babies because it occurs in the NICU and is often perturbed by antibiotics. We measured bacterial compositions and metabolomic profiles of 77 fecal samples from 32 preterm infants to investigate the differences between microbiomes in health and disease. Rather than finding microbial signatures of disease, we found that both the preterm infant microbiome and the metabolome were personalized and that the preterm infant gut microbiome is enriched in microbes that commonly dominate in the presence of antibiotics. These results contribute to the growing knowledge of the preterm infant microbiome and emphasize that a personalized view will be important to disentangle the health consequences of the preterm infant microbiome.},

abstract = {Background Dietary glycans, widely used as food ingredients and not directly digested by humans, are of intense interest for their beneficial roles in human health through shaping the microbiome. Characterizing the consistency and temporal responses of the gut microbiome to glycans is critical for rationally developing and deploying these compounds as therapeutics. Methods We investigated the effect of two chemically distinct glycans (fructooligosaccharides and polydextrose) through three clinical studies conducted with 80 healthy volunteers. Stool samples, collected at dense temporal resolution (~ 4 times per week over 10 weeks) and analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, enabled detailed characterization of participants’ microbiomes. For analyzing the microbiome time-series data, we developed MC-TIMME2 (Microbial Counts Trajectories Infinite Mixture Model Engine 2.0), a purpose-built computational tool based on nonparametric Bayesian methods that infer temporal patterns induced by perturbations and groups of microbes sharing these patterns. Results Overall microbiome structure as well as individual taxa showed rapid, consistent, and durable alterations across participants, regardless of compound dose or the order in which glycans were consumed. Significant changes also occurred in the abundances of microbial carbohydrate utilization genes in response to polydextrose, but not in response to fructooligosaccharides. Using MC-TIMME2, we produced detailed, high-resolution temporal maps of the microbiota in response to glycans within and across microbiomes. Conclusions Our findings indicate that dietary glycans cause reproducible, dynamic, and differential alterations to the community structure of the human microbiome.},

abstract = {With the rapid increase in sequencing data, human host status inference (e.g. healthy or sick) from microbiome data has become an important issue. Existing studies are mostly based on single-point microbiome composition, while it is rare that the host status is predicted from longitudinal microbiome data. However, single-point-based methods cannot capture the dynamic patterns between the temporal changes and host status. Therefore, it remains challenging to build good predictive models as well as scaling to different microbiome contexts. On the other hand, existing methods are mainly targeted for disease prediction and seldom investigate other host statuses. To fill the gap, we propose a comprehensive deep learning-based framework that utilizes longitudinal microbiome data as input to infer the human host status. Specifically, the framework is composed of specific data preparation strategies and a recurrent neural network tailored for longitudinal microbiome data. In experiments, we evaluated the proposed method on both semi-synthetic and real datasets based on different sequencing technologies and metagenomic contexts. The results indicate that our method achieves robust performance compared to other baseline and state-of-the-art classifiers and provides a significant reduction in prediction time.},

abstract = {A longitudinal strain-level analysis of the infant gut microbiome after repeated antibiotic treatments reveals decreased diversity and stability, as well as transient increases in antibiotic resistance genes. Elucidating the effects of drugs on bugs Despite widespread use of antibiotics in children, the effects of antibiotic exposure on the developing infant gut microbiome have remained underexplored. Here, Yassour et al. present a longitudinal study capturing how the gut microbiome responds to and recovers from antibiotic perturbations. Antibiotic-treated children had less stable and less diverse bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes within the guts of these children peaked after antibiotic treatment but generally returned rapidly to baseline. Delivery mode (vaginal versus cesarean) also had strong long-term effects on microbial diversity. These data give insights into the consequences of early life factors such as birth mode and antibiotic treatment on the infant gut microbiome. The gut microbial community is dynamic during the first 3 years of life, before stabilizing to an adult-like state. However, little is known about the impact of environmental factors on the developing human gut microbiome. We report a longitudinal study of the gut microbiome based on DNA sequence analysis of monthly stool samples and clinical information from 39 children, about half of whom received multiple courses of antibiotics during the first 3 years of life. Whereas the gut microbiome of most children born by vaginal delivery was dominated by Bacteroides species, the four children born by cesarean section and about 20% of vaginally born children lacked Bacteroides in the first 6 to 18 months of life. Longitudinal sampling, coupled with whole-genome shotgun sequencing, allowed detection of strain-level variation as well as the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. The microbiota of antibiotic-treated children was less diverse in terms of both bacterial species and strains, with some species often dominated by single strains. In addition, we observed short-term composition changes between consecutive samples from children treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes carried on microbial chromosomes showed a peak in abundance after antibiotic treatment followed by a sharp decline, whereas some genes carried on mobile elements persisted longer after antibiotic therapy ended. Our results highlight the value of high-density longitudinal sampling studies with high-resolution strain profiling for studying the establishment and response to perturbation of the infant gut microbiome.},

ABSTRACT The intestinal microbiota contains trillions of commensal microorganisms that shape multiple aspects of host physiology and disease. In contrast to the host’s genome, the microbiome is amenable to change over the course of an organism’s lifetime, providing an opportunity to therapeutically modulate the microbiome’s impact on human pathophysiology.

We propose that the identification of transient and intermediate states of microbiome responses to perturbations is essential for understanding the rules that govern the behavior of this ecosystem. The delineation of microbiome dynamics is also helpful for distinguishing cause and effect in microbiome responses to environmental stimuli. Understanding the dimension of time in host-microbiome interactions is therefore critical for therapeutic strategies that aim at short-term or long-term engineering of the intestinal microbial community.},

abstract = {The number of microbial and metagenomic studies has increased drastically due to advance-ments in next-generation sequencing-based measurement techniques. Statistical analysis and the validity of conclusions drawn from (time series) 16S rRNA and other metagenomic sequencing data is hampered by the presence of significant amount of noise and missing data (sampling zeros). Accounting uncertainty in microbiome data is often challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining biological replicates. Additionally, the compositional nature of current amplicon and metagenomic data differs from many other biological data types adding another challenge to the data analysis. To address these challenges in human microbiome research, we introduce a novel probabilistic approach to explicitly model overdispersion and sampling zeros by considering the temporal correlation between nearby time points using Gaussian Processes. The proposed Temporal Gaussian Process Model for Compositional Data Analysis (TGP-CODA) shows superior modeling performance compared to commonly used Dirichlet-multinomial, multinomial, and non-parametric regression models on real and synthetic data. We demonstrate that the nonreplicative nature of human gut microbiota studies can be partially overcome by our method with proper experimental design of dense temporal sampling. We also show that different modeling ap-proaches have a strong impact on ecological interpretation of the data, such as stationarity, persistence, and environmental noise models.

abstract = {BackgroundWhat is a healthy microbiome? The pursuit of this and many related questions, especially in light of the recently recognized microbial component in a wide range of diseases has sparked a surge in metagenomic studies. They are often not simply attributable to a single pathogen but rather are the result of complex ecological processes. Relatedly, the increasing DNA sequencing depth and number of samples in metagenomic case-control studies enabled the applicability of powerful statistical methods, e.g. Machine Learning approaches. For the latter, the feature space is typically shaped by the relative abundances of operational taxonomic units, as determined by cost-effective phylogenetic marker gene profiles. While a substantial body of microbiome/microbiota research involves unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning, very little attention has been put on feature selection and engineering.ResultsWe here propose the first algorithm to exploit phylogenetic hierarchy (i.e. an all-encompassing taxonomy) in feature engineering for microbiota classification. The rationale is to exploit the often mono- or oligophyletic distribution of relevant (but hidden) traits by virtue of taxonomic abstraction. The algorithm is embedded in a comprehensive microbiota classification pipeline, which we applied to a diverse range of datasets, distinguishing healthy from diseased microbiota samples.ConclusionWe demonstrate substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art microbiota classification tools in terms of classification accuracy, regardless of the actual Machine Learning technique while using drastically reduced feature spaces. Moreover, generalized features bear great explanatory value: they provide a concise description of conditions and thus help to provide pathophysiological insights.

abstract = {MOTIVATION
The human microbial communities are associated with many human diseases such as obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. High-throughput sequencing technology has been widely used to quantify the microbial composition in order to understand its impacts on human health. Longitudinal measurements of microbial communities are commonly obtained in many microbiome studies. A key question in such microbiome studies is to identify the microbes that are associated with clinical outcomes or environmental factors. However, microbiome compositional data are highly skewed, bounded in [0,1), and often sparse with many zeros. In addition, the observations from repeated measures in longitudinal studies are correlated. A method that takes into account these features is needed for association analysis in longitudinal microbiome data.


RESULTS
In this paper, we propose a two-part zero-inflated Beta regression model with random effects (ZIBR) for testing the association between microbial abundance and clinical covariates for longitudinal microbiome data. The model includes a logistic regression component to model presence/absence of a microbe in the samples and a Beta regression component to model non-zero microbial abundance, where each component includes a random effect to account for the correlations among the repeated measurements on the same subject. Both simulation studies and the application to real microbiome data have shown that ZIBR model outperformed the previously used methods. The method provides a useful tool for identifying the relevant taxa based on longitudinal or repeated measures in microbiome research.

abstract = {Background The assembly of the intestinal microbiota of extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants has an important impact on both immediate and long term health. ELBW infants are frequently given antibiotics which are likely to perturb the assembly of the microbiota. Health complications are not uncommon for ELBW infants; they face health crises including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Microbes are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of NEC, but the mechanisms are unclear. New understanding of the importance of human milk oligosaccharides and the establishment of a Bifidobacteria-dominated gut microbiota early in infancy suggest that all preterm infants have abnormal microbial colonization. The initial assembly of intestinal microbial communities may have significant impact on immune development and lifelong health. Results We measured the bacterial composition and metabolite profile of 32 ELBW infants by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry of fecal samples. Infants either remained healthy, developed late-onset sepsis, or developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The bacterial compositions were similar to what has been observed in other studies of preterm infants. Fecal samples are dominated by aero-tolerant bacterial species, specifically Enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcus. Only three ELBW infants were colonized by Bifidobacteria. Fecal samples from infants who developed NEC were not distinguishable from other infant samples based on bacterial compositions (Permanova R2 < 0.001, p = 0.99) or metabolite profiles (Permanova R2 = 0.05, p= 0.24). Instead the bacterial composition (R2 = 0.63, p < 0.001) and metabolite profile (R2 = 0.43, p < 0.001) were highly personalized for each infant. There were not significant correlations between the bacterial composition and metabolite profiles of fecal samples (Mantel test r= 0.18, p < 0.001). Conclusions Although antibiotics likely contribute to the instability of the ELBW infant intestinal microbiota, personalized signatures of bacteria and metabolites are still clearly present. Neither the bacterial composition or metabolite profile was unique in cases of disease. While bacteria certainly contribute to the profile of metabolites present in feces, in these ELBW infants, significant correlations between bacterial relative abundances as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted GC-MS metabolite profiles were not detectable.},

 Background Gut microbiome is gaining interest because its links with several diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Results Here we performed a meta-analysis of 851 fecal metagenomic samples from five publicly available studies. We used an interpretable machine learning approach based on functional profiles, instead of the conventional taxonomic profiles, to produce a highly accurate predictor of CRC with better precision than those of previous proposals. Moreover, this approach is also able to discriminate samples with adenoma, which makes this approach very promising for CRC prevention by detecting early stages in which intervention is easier and more effective. In addition, interpretable machine learning methods allows extracting features relevant for the classification, which reveals basic molecular mechanisms accounting for the changes underwent by the microbiome functional landscape in the transition from healthy gut to adenoma and CRC conditions. Conclusion Functional profiles provide superior accuracy in predicting CCR and adenoma conditions than taxonomic profiles and additionally, in a context of explainable machine learning, provide useful hints on the molecular mechanisms operating in the microbiota behind these conditions.},

abstract = {Longitudinal microbiome studies have been widely used to unveil the dynamics in the complex host-microbial ecosystems. Modeling the longitudinal microbiome compositional data, which is semi-continuous in nature, is challenging in several aspects: the overabundance of zeros, the heavy skewness of non-zero values that are bounded in (0, 1), and the dependence between the binary and non-zero parts. To deal with these challenges, we first extended the work of Chen and Li [1] and proposed a two-part zero-inflated Beta regression model with shared random effects (ZIBR-SRE), which characterize the dependence between the binary and the continuous parts. Besides, the microbiome compositional data have unit-sum constraint, indicating the existence of negative correlations among taxa. As ZIBR-SRE models each taxon separately, it does not satisfy the sum-to-one constraint. We then proposed a two-part linear mixed model (TPLMM) with shared random effects to formulate the log-transformed standardized relative abundances rather than the original ones. Such transformation is called “additive logistic transformation”, initially developed for cross-sectional compositional data. We extended it to analyze the longitudinal microbiome compositions and showed that the unit-sum constraint can be automatically satisfied under the TPLMM framework. Model performances of TPLMM and ZIBR-SRE were compared with existing methods in simulation studies. Under settings adopted from real data, TPLMM had the best performance and is recommended for practical use. An oral microbiome application further showed that TPLMM and ZIBR-SRE estimated a strong correlation structure in the binary and the continuous parts, suggesting models without accounting for this dependence would lead to biased inferences.},

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of various biosystems, ranging from the human body to the environment. A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes. Results k-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed the computationally costly Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking, and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments, and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87. For large datasets, deep learning outperformed classical methods such as Random Forest and SVM. Availability The software and datasets are available at https://llp.berkeley.edu/micropheno.},

abstract = {Discrete data such as counts of microbiome taxa resulting from next-generation sequencing are routinely encountered in bioinformatics. Taxa count data in microbiome studies are typically high-dimensional, over-dispersed, and can only reveal relative abundance therefore being treated as compositional. Analyzing compositional data presents many challenges because they are restricted on a simplex. In a logistic normal multinomial model, the relative abundance is mapped from a simplex to a latent variable that exists on the real Euclidean space using the additive log-ratio transformation. While a logistic normal multinomial approach brings in flexibility for modeling the data, it comes with a heavy computational cost as the parameter estimation typically relies on Bayesian techniques. In this paper, we develop a novel mixture of logistic normal multinomial models for clustering microbiome data. Additionally, we utilize an efficient framework for parameter estimation using variational Gaussian approximations (VGA). Adopting a variational Gaussian approximation for the posterior of the latent variable reduces the computational overhead substantially. The proposed method is illustrated on simulated and real datasets.},
