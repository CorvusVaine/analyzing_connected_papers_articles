abstract = {Shotgun sequencing has facilitated the analysis of complex microbial communities. Recently we have shown how local binary patterns (LBP) from image processing can be used to analyse the sequenced samples. LBP codes represent the data in a sparse high dimensional space. To improve the performance of our pipeline, marginalised stacked autoencoders are used here to learn frequent LBP codes and map the high dimensional space to a lower dimension dense space. We demonstrate its performance using both low and high complexity simulated metagenomic data and compare the performance of our method with several existing techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) in the dimension reduction step and fc-mer frequency in feature extraction step.},

We introduce a DNA sequence-to-signal mapping function based on the employment of doublet values, which increases the number of possible amplitude values for the generated signal. Additionally, we explore the use of three DSP distance metrics as descriptors for categorizing DNA signal fragments. Our results indicate the feasibility of employing GAFD for computing sequence distances and the use of descriptors for characterizing DNA fragments.},

abstract = {We introduce GATTACA, a framework for fast unsupervised binning of metagenomic contigs. Similar to recent approaches, GATTACA clusters contigs based on their coverage profiles across a large cohort of metagenomic samples; however, unlike previous methods that rely on read mapping, GATTACA quickly estimates these profiles from kmer counts stored in a compact index. This approach can result in over an order of magnitude speedup, while matching the accuracy of earlier methods on synthetic and real data benchmarks. It also provides a way to index metagenomic samples (e.g., from public repositories such as the Human Microbiome Project) offline once and reuse them across experiments; furthermore, the small size of the sample indices allows them to be easily transferred and stored. Leveraging the MinHash technique, GATTACA also provides an efficient way to identify publicly available metagenomic data that can be incorporated into the set of reference metagenomes to further improve binning accuracy. Thus, enabling easy indexing and reuse of publicly available metagenomic data sets, GATTACA makes accurate metagenomic analyses accessible to a much wider range of researchers.},

abstract = {One of main steps in a study of microbial communities is resolving their composition, diversity and function. In the past, these issues were mostly addressed by the use of amplicon sequencing of a target gene because of reasonable price and easier computational postprocessing of the bioinformatic data. With the advancement of sequencing techniques, the main focus shifted to the whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, which allows much more detailed analysis of the metagenomic data, including reconstruction of novel microbial genomes and to gain knowledge about genetic potential and metabolic capacities of whole environments. On the other hand, the output of whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing is mixture of short DNA fragments belonging to various genomes, therefore this approach requires more sophisticated computational algorithms for clustering of related sequences, commonly referred to as sequence binning. There are currently two types of binning methods: taxonomy dependent and taxonomy independent. The first type classifies the DNA fragments by performing a standard homology inference against a reference database, while the latter performs the reference-free binning by applying clustering techniques on features extracted from the sequences. In this review, we describe the strategies within the second approach. Although these strategies do not require prior knowledge, they have higher demands on the length of sequences. Besides their basic principle, an overview of particular methods and tools is provided. Furthermore, the review covers the utilization of the methods in context with the length of sequences and discusses the needs for metagenomic data preprocessing in form of initial assembly prior to binning.},

abstract = {Background: The study of microbiomes using whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial populations that may have important roles in their environments. Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools for their evaluation and visualization. Results: To address these challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give investigators control over the analysis, while still being easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP’s hybrid bin extraction algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real datasets. Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance estimation, functional annotation, and visualization. Conclusions: MetaWRAP is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant improvements to the extraction and interpretation of high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.

abstract = {Abstract Metagenomics-based studies of mixed microbial communities are impacting biotechnology, life sciences and medicine. Computational binning of metagenomic data is a powerful approach for the culture-independent recovery of population-resolved genomic sequences, i.e. from individual or closely related, constituent microorganisms. Existing binning solutions often require a priori characterized reference genomes and/or dedicated compute resources. Extending currently available reference-independent binning tools, we developed the BusyBee Web server for the automated deconvolution of metagenomic data into population-level genomic bins using assembled contigs (Illumina) or long reads (Pacific Biosciences, Oxford Nanopore Technologies). A reversible compression step as well as bootstrapped supervised binning enable quick turnaround times. The binning results are represented in interactive 2D scatterplots. Moreover, bin quality estimates, taxonomic annotations and annotations of antibiotic resistance genes are computed and visualized. Ground truth-based benchmarks of BusyBee Web demonstrate comparably high performance to state-of-the-art binning solutions for assembled contigs and markedly improved performance for long reads (median F1 scores: 70.02–95.21%). Furthermore, the applicability to real-world metagenomic datasets is shown. In conclusion, our reference-independent approach automatically bins assembled contigs or long reads, exhibits high sensitivity and precision, enables intuitive inspection of the results, and only requires FASTA-formatted input.

abstract = {BackgroundIn metagenomics, the separation of nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely matched populations is termed binning. Binning helps the evaluation of underlying microbial population structure as well as the recovery of individual genomes from a sample of uncultivable microbial organisms. Both supervised and unsupervised learning methods have been employed in binning; however, characterizing a metagenomic sample containing multiple strains remains a significant challenge.In this study, we designed and implemented a new workflow, Coverage and composition based binning of Metagenomes (CoMet), for binning contigs in a single metagenomic sample. CoMet utilizes coverage values and the compositional features of metagenomic contigs. The binning strategy in CoMet includes the initial grouping of contigs in guanine-cytosine (GC) content-coverage space and refinement of bins in tetranucleotide frequencies space in a purely unsupervised manner. With CoMet, the clustering algorithm DBSCAN is employed for binning contigs. The performances of CoMet were compared against four existing approaches for binning a single metagenomic sample, including MaxBin, Metawatt, MyCC (default) and MyCC (coverage) using multiple datasets including a sample comprised of multiple strains.ResultsBinning methods based on both compositional features and coverages of contigs had higher performances than the method which is based only on compositional features of contigs. CoMet yielded higher or comparable precision in comparison to the existing binning methods on benchmark datasets of varying complexities. MyCC (coverage) had the highest ranking score in F1-score. However, the performances of CoMet were higher than MyCC (coverage) on the dataset containing multiple strains. Furthermore, CoMet recovered contigs of more species and was 18 - 39% higher in precision than the compared existing methods in discriminating species from the sample of multiple strains. CoMet resulted in higher precision than MyCC (default) and MyCC (coverage) on a real metagenome.ConclusionsThe approach proposed with CoMet for binning contigs, improves the precision of binning while characterizing more species in a single metagenomic sample and in a sample containing multiple strains. The F1-scores obtained from different binning strategies vary with different datasets; however, CoMet yields the highest F1-score with a sample comprised of multiple strains.},

The recovery of genomes from metagenomic datasets is a critical step to defining the functional roles of the underlying uncultivated populations. We previously developed MaxBin, an automated binning approach for high-throughput recovery of microbial genomes from metagenomes. Here we present an expanded binning algorithm, MaxBin 2.0, which recovers genomes from co-assembly of a collection of metagenomic datasets. Tests on simulated datasets revealed that MaxBin 2.0 is highly accurate in recovering individual genomes, and the application of MaxBin 2.0 to several metagenomes from environmental samples demonstrated that it could achieve two complementary goals: recovering more bacterial genomes compared to binning a single sample as well as comparing the microbial community composition between different sampling environments.

abstract = {BackgroundMetagenomics sequencing provides deep insights into microbial communities. To investigate their taxonomic structure, binning assembled contigs into discrete clusters is critical. Many binning algorithms have been developed, but their performance is not always satisfactory, especially for complex microbial communities, calling for further development.ResultsAccording to previous studies, relative sequence compositions are similar across different regions of the same genome, but they differ between distinct genomes. Generally, current tools have used the normalized frequency of k-tuples directly, but this represents an absolute, not relative, sequence composition. Therefore, we attempted to model contigs using relative k-tuple composition, followed by measuring dissimilarity between contigs using d2S$$ {d}_2^S $$. The d2S$$ {d}_2^S $$ was designed to measure the dissimilarity between two long sequences or Next-Generation Sequencing data with the Markov models of the background genomes. This method was effective in revealing group and gradient relationships between genomes, metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. With many binning tools available, we do not try to bin contigs from scratch. Instead, we developed d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$ to adjust contigs among bins based on the output of existing binning tools for a single metagenomic sample. The tool is taxonomy-free and depends only on k-tuples. To evaluate the performance of d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$, five widely used binning tools with different strategies of sequence composition or the hybrid of sequence composition and abundance were selected to bin six synthetic and real datasets, after which d2SBin$$ {d}_2^S\mathrm{Bin} $$ was applied to adjust the binning results.

abstract = {Motivation: The advent of next‐generation sequencing technologies enables researchers to sequence complex microbial communities directly from the environment. Because assembly typically produces only genome fragments, also known as contigs, instead of an entire genome, it is crucial to group them into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for further taxonomic profiling and down‐streaming functional analysis. OTU clustering is also referred to as binning. We present COCACOLA, a general framework automatically bin contigs into OTUs based on sequence composition and coverage across multiple samples. Results: The effectiveness of COCACOLA is demonstrated in both simulated and real datasets in comparison with state‐of‐art binning approaches such as CONCOCT, GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT. The superior performance of COCACOLA relies on two aspects. One is using L1 distance instead of Euclidean distance for better taxonomic identification during initialization. More importantly, COCACOLA takes advantage of both hard clustering and soft clustering by sparsity regularization. In addition, the COCACOLA framework seamlessly embraces customized knowledge to facilitate binning accuracy. In our study, we have investigated two types of additional knowledge, the co‐alignment to reference genomes and linkage of contigs provided by paired‐end reads, as well as the ensemble of both. We find that both co‐alignment and linkage information further improve binning in the majority of cases. COCACOLA is scalable and faster than CONCOCT, GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT.

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Metagenomic contig binning is an important computational problem in metagenomic research, which aims to cluster contigs from the same genome into the same group. Unlike classical clustering problem, contig binning can utilize known relationships among some of the contigs or the taxonomic identity of some contigs. However, the current state-of-the-art contig binning methods do not make full use of the additional biological information except the coverage and sequence composition of the contigs.


RESULTS
We developed a novel contig binning method, SolidBin (Semi-supervised Spectral Normalized Cut for Binning), based on semi-supervised spectral clustering. Using sequence feature similarity and/or additional biological information, such as the reliable taxonomy assignments of some contigs, SolidBin constructs two types of prior information: must-link and cannot-link constraints. Must-link constraints mean that the pair of contigs should be clustered into the same group, while cannot-link constraints mean that the pair of contigs should be clustered in different groups. These constraints are then integrated into a classical spectral clustering approach, normalized cut (NCut), for improved contig binning. The performance of SolidBin is compared with five state-of-the-art genome binners, CONCOCT, COCACOLA, MaxBin, MetaBAT and BMC3C on five next-generation sequencing (NGS) benchmark datasets including simulated multi- and single-sample datasets and real multi-sample datasets. The experimental results show that, SolidBin has achieved the best performance in terms of F-score, ARI and NMI, especially while using the real datasets and the single sample dataset.

A key step in a metagenomic study is to group nucleotide sequences belonging to an individual or closely related species which is often termed binning. Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.},

abstract = {Metagenomics has become an integral part of defining microbial diversity in various environments. Many ecosystems have characteristically low biomass and few cultured representatives. Linking potential metabolisms to phylogeny in environmental microorganisms is important for interpreting microbial community functions and the impacts these communities have on geochemical cycles. However, with metagenomic studies there is the computational hurdle of ‘binning’ contigs into phylogenetically related units or putative genomes. Binning methods have been implemented with varying approaches such as k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and two-way clustering; however, many of these suffer from biases against low coverage/abundance organisms and closely related taxa/strains. We are introducing a new binning method, BinSanity, that utilizes the clustering algorithm affinity propagation (AP), to cluster assemblies using coverage alone, removing potential composition based biases in clustering contigs, but requires a minimum of two samples. To increase fidelity, a refinement script was developed that uses composition data (tetranucleotide frequency and %G+C content) to refine bins containing multiple source organisms. This separation of composition and coverage based signatures reduces clustering bias for closely related taxa. BinSanity was developed and tested on artificial metagenomes varying in size and complexity. Results indicate that this implementation of AP lead to a higher precision, recall, and Adjusted Rand Index over five commonly implemented methods. When tested on a previously published infant gut metagenome, BinSanity generated high completion and low redundancy bins corresponding with the published metagenome-assembled genomes.},

abstract = {BackgroundInferring phylogenetic trees for newly recovered genomes from metagenomic samples is very useful in determining the identities of uncultivated microorganisms. Even though 16S ribosomal RNA small subunit genes have been established as “gold standard” markers for inferring phylogenetic trees, they usually cannot be assembled very well in metagenomes due to shared regions among 16S genes. Using single-copy marker genes to build genome trees has become increasingly popular for uncultivated species. Predefined marker gene sets were discovered and have been applied in various genomic studies; however these gene sets might not be adequate for novel, uncultivated, draft, or incomplete genomes. The automatic identification of marker gene sets among a set of genomes with different assembly qualities has thus become a very important task for inferring reliable phylogenetic relationships for microbial populations.ResultsA computational pipeline, ezTree, was developed to automatically identify single-copy marker genes for a group of genomes and build phylogenetic trees from the marker genes. Testing ezTree on a group of proteobacteria species revealed that ezTree was highly effective in pinpointing marker genes and constructing reliable trees for different groups of bacterial genomes. Applying ezTree to genomes that were recently recovered from metagenomes also showed that ezTree can help elucidate taxonomic relationships among newly recovered genomes and existing ones.ConclusionsThe development of ezTree can help scientists build reliable phylogenetic trees for uncultivated species retrieved from environmental samples. The uncovered single-copy marker genes may also provide crucial hints for understanding shared features of a group of microbes.

abstract = {MOTIVATION
The field of metagenomics has provided valuable insights into the structure, diversity and ecology within microbial communities. One key step in metagenomics analysis is to assemble reads into longer contigs which are then binned into groups of contigs that belong to different species present in the metagenomic sample. Binning of contigs plays an important role in metagenomics and most available binning algorithms bin contigs using genomic features such as oligonucleotide/k-mer composition and contig coverage. As metagenomic contigs are derived from the assembly process, they are output from the underlying assembly graph which contains valuable connectivity information between contigs that can be used for binning.


RESULTS
We propose GraphBin, a new binning method that makes use of the assembly graph and applies a label propagation algorithm to refine the binning result of existing tools.We show that GraphBin can make use of the assembly graphs constructed from both the de Bruijn graph and the overlap-layout-consensus approach. Moreover, we demonstrate improved experimental results from GraphBin in terms of identifying mis-binned contigs and binning of contigs discarded by existing binning tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the information from the assembly graph has been used in a tool for the binning of metagenomic contigs.

abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomics investigates the DNA sequences directly recovered from environmental samples. It often starts with reads assembly, which leads to contigs rather than more complete genomes. Therefore, contig binning methods are subsequently used to bin contigs into genome bins. While some clustering‐based binning methods have been developed, they generally suffer from problems related to stability and robustness. Results: We introduce BMC3C, an ensemble clustering‐based method, to accurately and robustly bin contigs by making use of DNA sequence Composition, Coverage across multiple samples and Codon usage. BMC3C begins by searching the proper number of clusters and repeatedly applying the k‐means clustering with different initializations to cluster contigs. Next, a weight graph with each node representing a contig is derived from these clusters. If two contigs are frequently grouped into the same cluster, the weight between them is high, and otherwise low. BMC3C finally employs a graph partitioning technique to partition the weight graph into subgraphs, each corresponding to a genome bin. We conduct experiments on both simulated and real‐world datasets to evaluate BMC3C, and compare it with the state‐of‐the‐art binning tools. We show that BMC3C has an improved performance compared to these tools. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the codon usage features and ensemble clustering are used in metagenomic contig binning.

A key objective of metagenomic studies is to analyse organism-specific metabolic pathways and reconstruct community interaction networks. This requires accurate assignment of assembled genome fragments to genomes.

Furthermore, the performance of existing algorithms varies between samples and biotopes. Here, we present a dereplication, aggregation and scoring strategy, DAS Tool, that combines the strengths of a flexible set of established binning algorithms.

Indeed, when applied to environmental and host-associated samples of different complexity, DAS Tool recovered substantially more near-complete genomes, including previously unreported lineages, than any single binning method alone. The ability to reconstruct many near-complete genomes from metagenomics data will greatly advance genome-centric analyses of ecosystems.Here the authors present a tool that enables a flexible set of existing binning algorithms to be combined, resulting in improved binning accuracy and the recovery of more near-complete genomes from metagenomes compared to standalone methods.},

abstract = {Background Metagenomics technology can directly extract microbial genetic material from the environmental samples to obtain their sequencing reads, which can be further assembled into contigs through assembly tools. Clustering methods of contigs are subsequently applied to recover complete genomes from environmental samples. The main problems with current clustering methods are that they cannot recover more high-quality genes from complex environments. Firstly, there are multiple strains under the same species, resulting in assembly of chimeras. Secondly, different strains under the same species are difficult to be classified. Thirdly, it is difficult to determine the number of strains during the clustering process. Results In view of the shortcomings of current clustering methods, we propose an unsupervised clustering method which can improve the ability to recover genes from complex environments and a new method for selecting the number of sample’s strains in clustering process. The sequence composition characteristics (tetranucleotide frequency) and co-abundance are combined to train the probability model for clustering. A new recursive method that can continuously reduce the complexity of the samples is proposed to improve the ability to recover genes from complex environments. The new clustering method was tested on both simulated and real metagenomic datasets, and compared with five state-of-the-art methods including CONCOCT, Maxbin2.0, MetaBAT, MyCC and COCACOLA. In terms of the number and quality of recovered genes from metagenomic datasets, the results show that our proposed method is more effective.

abstract = {We introduce GATTACA, a framework for rapid and accurate binning of metagenomic contigs from a single or multiple metagenomic samples into clusters associated with individual species. The clusters are computed using co-abundance profiles within a set of reference metagnomes; unlike previous methods, GATTACA estimates these profiles from k-mer counts stored in a highly compact index. On multiple synthetic and real benchmark datasets, GATTACA produces clusters that correspond to distinct bacterial species with an accuracy that matches earlier methods, while being up to 20× faster when the reference panel index can be computed offline and 6× faster for online co-abundance estimation. Leveraging the MinHash technique to quickly compare metagenomic samples, GATTACA also provides an efficient way to identify publicly-available metagenomic data that can be incorporated into the set of reference metagenomes to further improve binning accuracy. Thus, enabling easy indexing and reuse of publicly-available metagenomic datasets, GATTACA makes accurate metagenomic analyses accessible to a much wider range of researchers.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe study of microbiomes using whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial populations that may have important roles in their environments. Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools for their evaluation and visualization.ResultsTo address these challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give investigators control over the analysis, while still being easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP’s hybrid bin extraction algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real data sets. Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance estimation, functional annotation, and visualization.ConclusionsMetaWRAP is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant improvements to the extraction and interpretation of high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling metagenomic shotgun sequencing data. MetaWRAP is open-source software available at https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP.},

abstract = {Background Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study the structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for binning contigs only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species). Results In this paper, we introduce GraphBin2 which refines the binning results obtained from existing tools and, more importantly, is able to assign contigs to multiple bins. GraphBin2 uses the connectivity and coverage information from assembly graphs to adjust existing binning results on contigs and to infer contigs shared by multiple species. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that GraphBin2 not only improves binning results of existing tools but also supports to assign contigs to multiple bins. Conclusion GraphBin2 incorporates the coverage information into the assembly graph to refine the binning results obtained from existing binning tools. GraphBin2 also enables the detection of contigs that may belong to multiple species. We show that GraphBin2 outperforms its predecessor GraphBin on both simulated and real datasets.

abstract = {BackgroundRecent advances in high-throughput sequencing allow for much deeper exploitation of natural and engineered microbial communities, and to unravel so-called “microbial dark matter” (microbes that until now have evaded cultivation). Metagenomic analyses result in a large number of genomic fragments (contigs) that need to be grouped (binned) in order to reconstruct draft microbial genomes. While several contig binning algorithms have been developed in the past 2 years, they often lack consensus. Furthermore, these software tools typically lack a provision for the visualization of data and bin characteristics.ResultsWe present ICoVeR, the Interactive Contig-bin Verification and Refinement tool, which allows the visualization of genome bins. More specifically, ICoVeR allows curation of bin assignments based on multiple binning algorithms. Its visualization window is composed of two connected and interactive main views, including a parallel coordinates view and a dimensionality reduction plot. To demonstrate ICoVeR’s utility, we used it to refine disparate genome bins automatically generated using MetaBAT, CONCOCT and MyCC for an anaerobic digestion metagenomic (AD microbiome) dataset. Out of 31 refined genome bins, 23 were characterized with higher completeness and lower contamination in comparison to their respective, automatically generated, genome bins. Additionally, to benchmark ICoVeR against a previously validated dataset, we used Sharon’s dataset representing an infant gut metagenome.ConclusionsICoVeR is an open source software package that allows curation of disparate genome bins generated with automatic binning algorithms. It is freely available under the GPLv3 license at https://git.list.lu/eScience/ICoVeR. The data management and analytical functions of ICoVeR are implemented in R, therefore the software can be easily installed on any system for which R is available. Installation and usage guide together with the example files ready to be visualized are also provided via the project wiki. ICoVeR running instance preloaded with AD microbiome and Sharon’s datasets can be accessed via the website.},
