While the pairing contribution to the net free energy is well parameterized and can be computed in O(N) time, the cost of removing pre-existing mRNA secondary structure has not received sufficient attention. Conventional methods for computing the unfolding free energy of a target mRNA are costly, scaling like the cube of the number of target bases O(N3). Here we introduce a model to describe the unfolding costs of the binding site, which features surprisingly big differences in the free energy parameters for the four bases. The model is implemented in our O(N) algorithm, BindOligoNet. Donor splice site prediction is more accurate when using our calculation of spliceosomal U1-snRNA to mRNA net binding free energy. Our base-dependent free energies also correlate with efficient ribosome docking near the start codon.},

abstract = {Summary: We introduce RBPBind, a web-based tool for the quantitative prediction of RNA-protein interactions. Given a user-specified RNA and a protein selected from a set of several common RNA-binding proteins, RBPBind computes the binding curve and effective binding constant of the reaction in question. The server also computes the probability that, at a given concentration of protein, a protein molecule will bind to any particular nucleotide along the RNA. The software for RBPBind is adapted from the Vienna RNA package, whose source code has been modified to accommodate the effects of single stranded RNA binding proteins. RBPBind thus fully incorporates the effect of RNA secondary structure on protein-RNA interactions. Availability: Our web server is available at this http URL},

abstract = {Detecting viral and vector integration events is a key step when investigating interactions between viral and host genomes. This is relevant in several fields, including virology, cancer research and gene therapy. For example, investigating integrations of wild-type viruses such as human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus has proven to be crucial for understanding the role of these integrations in cancer. Furthermore, identifying the extent of vector integration is vital for determining the potential for genotoxicity in gene therapies. To address these questions, we developed isling, the first tool specifically designed for identifying viral integrations in both wild-type and vector from next-generation sequencing data. Isling addresses complexities in integration behaviour including integration of fragmented genomes and integration junctions with ambiguous locations in a host or vector genome, and can also flag possible vector recombinations. We show that isling is up to 1.6-fold faster and up to 170% more accurate than other viral integration tools, and performs well on both simulated and real datasets. Isling is therefore an efficient and application-agnostic tool that will enable a broad range of investigations into viral and vector integration. These include comparisons between integrations of wild-type viruses and gene therapy vectors, as well as assessing the genotoxicity of vectors and understanding the role of viruses in cancer.},

DNA sequencing has revealed the surprising extent of microbial diversity and how microbial processes run global ecosystems. However, significant gaps in our understanding of the microbial world remain, and one example is that microbial eukaryotes, or protists, are still largely neglected. To address this gap, we used gene expression data from 17 protist species to create protist.guru: an online database equipped with tools for identifying co-expressed genes, gene families, and co-expression clusters enriched for specific biological functions. Here, we show how our database can be used to reveal genes involved in essential pathways, such as the synthesis of secondary carotenoids in Haematococcus lacustris. We expect protist.guru to serve as a valuable resource for protistologists, as well as a catalyst for discoveries and new insights into the biological processes of microbial eukaryotes.

abstract = {Computational modeling of nucleic acids plays an important role in molecular biology, enhancing our general understanding of the relationship between structure and function. Biophysical studies have provided a wealth of information on how double-helical DNA responds to proteins and other molecules in its local environment but far less understanding of the larger scale structural responses found in protein-decorated loops and minicircles. Current computational models of DNA range from detailed all-atom molecular dynamics studies, which produce rich time and spatially dependent depictions of small DNA fragments, to coarse-grained simulations, which sacrifice detailed physical and chemical information to treat larger scale systems. The treatment of DNA used here, at the base-pair step level with rigid-body parameters, allows one to develop quality models hundreds of base pairs long from local, sequence-specific features found from experiment. The emDNA software takes advantage of this framework, producing elastically optimized models of DNA at thermal equilibrium with built-in or user-generated elastic models. This versatile program, in combination with case studies included in this article, allows users of any skill level to develop and investigate mesoscale models of their own design. The functionality of emDNA includes a tool to incorporate experiment-specific configurations, e.g. protein-bound and/or melted DNA from known high-resolution structures, within higher-order 3D models by fixing the orientation and position of user-specified base pairs. The software provides a new avenue into multiscale genetic modeling, giving a wide range of users a deeper understanding of DNA mesoscale organization and the opportunity to pose new questions in genetic research. The publicly available emDNA software, including build instructions and usage information, is available on GitHub (https://nicocvn.github.io/emDNA/).},

abstract = {Proteome-wide identification of protein-protein interactions is a formidable task which has yet to be sufficiently addressed by experimental methodologies. Many computational methods have been developed to predict proteome-wide interaction networks, but few leverage both the sensitivity of structural information and the wide availability of sequence data. We present PEPPI, a pipeline which integrates structural similarity, sequence similarity, functional association data, and machine learning-based classification through a na√Øve Bayesian classifier model to accurately predict protein-protein interactions at a proteomic scale. Through benchmarking against a set of 798 ground truth interactions and an equal number of noninteractions, we have found that PEPPI attains 4.5% higher AUROC than the best of other state-of-the-art methods. As a proteomic-scale application, PEPPI was applied to model the interactions which occur between SARS-CoV-2 and human host cells during coronavirus infection, where 403 high-confidence interactions were identified with predictions covering 73% of a gold standard dataset from PSICQUIC and demonstrating significant complementarity with the most recent high-throughput experiments. PEPPI is available both as a webserver and in a standalone version and should be a powerful and generally applicable tool for computational screening of protein-protein interactions.},

Extensions of PDBx/mmCIF are similarly used for computed structure models by ModelArchive (modelarchive.org), integrative/hybrid structures by PDB-Dev (pdb-dev.wwpdb.org), small angle scattering data by Small Angle Scattering Biological Data Bank SASBDB (sasbdb.org), and for models computed generated with the AlphaFold 2.0 deep learning software suite (alphafold.ebi.ac.uk). Community-driven development of PDBx/mmCIF spans three decades, involving contributions from researchers, software and methods developers in structural sciences, data repository providers, scientific publishers, and professional societies. Having a semantically rich and extensible data framework for representing a wide range of structural biology experimental and computational results, combined with expertly curated 3D biostructure data sets in public repositories, accelerates the pace of scientific discovery.

abstract = {Visualizing single-cell transcriptomics data in an informative way is a major challenge in biological data analysis. Clustering of cells is a prominent analysis step and the results are usually visualized in a planar embedding of the cells using methods like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP. Given a cluster of cells, one frequently searches for the genes highly expressed specifically in that cluster. At this point, visualization is usually replaced by studying a list of differentially expressed genes. Association Plots are derived from correspondence analysis and constitute a planar visualization of the features which characterize a given cluster of observations. We have adapted Association Plots to address the challenge of visualizing cluster-specific genes in large single-cell data sets. Our method is made available as a free R package called APL. We demonstrate the application of APL and Association Plots to single-cell RNA-seq data on two example data sets. First, we present how to delineate novel marker genes using Association Plots with the example of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell data. Second, we show how to apply Association Plots for annotating cell clusters to known cell types using Association Plots and a predefined list of marker genes. To do this we will use data from the human cell atlas of fetal gene expression. Results from Association Plots will also be compared to methods for deriving differentially expressed genes, and we will show the integration of APL with Gene Ontology Enrichment.},

Computational approaches are orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than experimental ones, leading to proliferation of multiple methods aimed to predict which residues belong to the interface of an interaction. Results We present BIPSPI, a new machine learning‚Äêbased method for the prediction of partner‚Äêspecific PPI sites. Contrary to most binding site prediction methods, the proposed approach takes into account a pair of interacting proteins rather than a single one in order to predict partner‚Äêspecific binding sites. BIPSPI has been trained employing sequence‚Äêbased and structural features from both protein partners of each complex compiled in the Protein‚ÄêProtein Docking Benchmark version 5.0 and in an additional set independently compiled. Also, a version trained only on sequences has been developed. The performance of our approach has been assessed by a leave‚Äêone‚Äêout cross‚Äêvalidation over different benchmarks, outperforming state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart methods.

Whether performance in such tasks can be improved by using large repositories of tangentially related structural data remains an open question.

We built a training dataset, the Database of Interacting Protein Structures (DIPS), that contains biases but is two orders of magnitude larger than those used previously. We found that these biases significantly degrade the performance of existing methods on gold-standard data. Hypothesizing that assumptions baked into the hand-crafted features on which these methods depend were the source of the problem, we developed the first end-to-end learning model for protein interface prediction, the Siamese Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet).

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Protein-protein interactions drive wide-ranging molecular processes, and characterizing at the atomic level how proteins interact (beyond just the fact that they interact) can provide key insights into understanding and controlling this machinery. Unfortunately, experimental determination of three-dimensional protein complex structures remains difficult and does not scale to the increasingly large sets of proteins whose interactions are of interest. Computational methods are thus required to meet the demands of large-scale, high-throughput prediction of how proteins interact, but unfortunately both physical modeling and machine learning methods suffer from poor precision and/or recall.


RESULTS
In order to improve performance in predicting protein interaction interfaces, we leverage the best properties of both data- and physics-driven methods to develop a unified Geometric Deep Neural Network, "PInet" (Protein Interface Network). PInet consumes pairs of point clouds encoding the structures of two partner proteins, in order to predict their structural regions mediating interaction. To make such predictions, PInet learns and utilizes models capturing both geometrical and physicochemical molecular surface complementarity. In application to a set of benchmarks, PInet simultaneously predicts the interface regions on both interacting proteins, achieving performance equivalent to or even much better than the state-of-the-art predictor for each dataset. Furthermore, since PInet is based on joint segmentation of a representation of a protein surfaces, its predictions are meaningful in terms of the underlying physical complementarity driving molecular recognition.

abstract = {Protein interactions are important in a broad range of biological processes. Traditionally, computational methods have been developed to automatically predict protein interface from hand-crafted features. Recent approaches employ deep neural networks and predict the interaction of each amino acid pair independently. However, these methods do not incorporate the important sequential information from amino acid chains and the high-order pairwise interactions. Intuitively, the prediction of an amino acid pair should depend on both their features and the information of other amino acid pairs. In this work, we propose to formulate the protein interface prediction as a 2D dense prediction problem. In addition, we propose a novel deep model to incorporate the sequential information and high-order pairwise interactions to perform interface predictions. We represent proteins as graphs and employ graph neural networks to learn node features. Then we propose the sequential modeling method to incorporate the sequential information and reorder the feature matrix. Next, we incorporate high-order pairwise interactions to generate a 3D tensor containing different pairwise interactions. Finally, we employ convolutional neural networks to perform 2D dense predictions. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method can consistently improve the protein interface prediction performance.},

abstract = {An integrated method for protein interface prediction (ISPIP) is described to explore the hypothesis that the efficacy of a computational prediction method of protein binding sites can be enhanced by using a combination of methods that rely on orthogonal structure-based properties of a query protein. Background Identifying protein interfaces can inform how proteins interact with their binding partners, uncover the regulatory mechanisms that control biological functions and guide the development of novel therapeutic agents. A variety of computational approaches have been developed for predicting a protein‚Äôs interfacial residues from its known sequence and structure. Methods using the known three-dimensional structures of proteins can be template-based or template-free. Template-based methods have limited success in predicting interfaces when homologues with known complex structures are not available to use as templates. The prediction performance of template-free methods that only rely only upon proteins‚Äô intrinsic properties is limited by the amount of biologically relevant features that can be included in an interface prediction model. Results We describe the development of an integrated method for protein interface prediction (ISPIP) to explore the hypothesis that the efficacy of a computational prediction method of protein binding sites can be enhanced by using a combination of methods that rely on orthogonal structure-based properties of a query protein, combining and balancing both template-free and template-based features. ISPIP is a method that integrates these approaches through simple linear or logistic regression models and more complex decision tree models. On a diverse test set of 156 query proteins, ISPIP outperforms each of its individual classifiers in identifying protein binding interfaces. Conclusions The integrated method captures the best performance of individual classifiers and delivers an improved interface prediction. The method is robust and performs well even when one of the individual classifiers performs poorly on a particular query protein. This work demonstrates that integrating orthogonal methods that depend on different structural properties of proteins performs better at interface prediction than any individual classifier alone.},
