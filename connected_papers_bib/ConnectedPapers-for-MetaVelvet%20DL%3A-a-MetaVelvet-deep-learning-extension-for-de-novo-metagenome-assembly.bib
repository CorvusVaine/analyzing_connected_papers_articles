abstract = {Background The increasing use of whole metagenome sequencing has spurred the need to improve de novo assemblers to facilitate the discovery of unknown species and the analysis of their genomic functions. MetaVelvet-SL is a short-read de novo metagenome assembler that partitions a multi-species de Bruijn graph into single-species sub-graphs. This study aimed to improve the performance of MetaVelvet-SL by using a deep learning-based model to predict the partition nodes in a multi-species de Bruijn graph. Results This study showed that the recent advances in deep learning offer the opportunity to better exploit sequence information and differentiate genomes of different species in a metagenomic sample. We developed an extension to MetaVelvet-SL, which we named MetaVelvet-DL, that builds an end-to-end architecture using Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory units. The deep learning model in MetaVelvet-DL can more accurately predict how to partition a de Bruijn graph than the Support Vector Machine-based model in MetaVelvet-SL can. Assembly of the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) dataset showed that after removing chimeric assemblies, MetaVelvet-DL produced longer single-species contigs, with less misassembled contigs than MetaVelvet-SL did. Conclusions MetaVelvet-DL provides more accurate de novo assemblies of whole metagenome data. The authors believe that this improvement can help in furthering the understanding of microbiomes by providing a more accurate description of the metagenomic samples under analysis.},

abstract = {BackgroundA crucial task in metagenomic analysis is to annotate the function and taxonomy of the sequencing reads generated from a microbiome sample. In general, the reads can either be assembled into contigs and searched against reference databases, or individually searched without assembly. The first approach may suffer from fragmentary and incomplete assembly, while the second is hampered by the reduced functional signal contained in the short reads. To tackle these issues, we have previously developed GRASP (Guided Reference-based Assembly of Short Peptides), which accepts a reference protein sequence as input and aims to assemble its homologs from a database containing fragmentary protein sequences. In addition to a gene-centric assembly tool, GRASP also serves as a homolog search tool when using the assembled protein sequences as templates to recruit reads. GRASP has significantly improved recall rate (60–80% vs. 30–40%) compared to other homolog search tools such as BLAST. However, GRASP is both time- and space-consuming. Subsequently, we developed GRASPx, which is 30X faster than GRASP. Here, we present a completely redesigned algorithm, GRASP2, for this computational problem.ResultsGRASP2 utilizes Burrows-Wheeler Transformation (BWT) and FM-index to perform assembly graph generation, and reduces the search space by employing a fast ungapped alignment strategy as a filter. GRASP2 also explicitly generates candidate paths prior to alignment, which effectively uncouples the iterative access of the assembly graph and alignment matrix. This strategy makes the execution of the program more efficient under current computer architecture, and contributes to GRASP2’s speedup.GRASP2 is 8-fold faster than GRASPx (and 250-fold faster than GRASP) and uses 8-fold less memory while maintaining the original high recall rate of GRASP. GRASP2 reaches ~ 80% recall rate compared to that of ~ 40% generated by BLAST, both at a high precision level (> 95%). With such a high performance, GRASP2 is only ~3X slower than BLASTP.ConclusionGRASP2 is a high-performance gene-centric and homolog search tool with significant speedup compared to its predecessors, which makes GRASP2 a useful tool for metagenomics data analysis, GRASP2 is implemented in C++ and is freely available from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/grasp2.},

abstract = {Motivation
With the recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies, the study of the genetic composition of living organisms has become more accessible for researchers. Several advances have been achieved because of it, especially in the health sciences. However, many challenges which emerge from the complexity of sequencing projects remain unsolved. Among them is the task of assembling DNA fragments from previously unsequenced organisms, which is classified as an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial time hard) problem, for which no efficient computational solution with reasonable execution time exists. However, several tools that produce approximate solutions have been used with results that have facilitated scientific discoveries, although there is ample room for improvement. As with other NP-hard problems, machine learning algorithms have been one of the approaches used in recent years in an attempt to find better solutions to the DNA fragment assembly problem, although still at a low scale.

This paper presents a broad review of pioneering literature comprising artificial intelligence-based DNA assemblers-particularly the ones that use machine learning-to provide an overview of state-of-the-art approaches and to serve as a starting point for further study in this field.},

abstract = {The study of metagenomics has been much benefited from low-cost and high-throughput sequencing technologies, yet the tremendous amount of data generated make analysis like de novo assembly to consume too much computational resources. In late 2014 we released MEGAHIT v0.1 (together with a brief note of Li et al. (2015) [1]), which is the first NGS metagenome assembler that can assemble genome sequences from metagenomic datasets of hundreds of Giga base-pairs (bp) in a time- and memory-efficient manner on a single server. The core of MEGAHIT is an efficient parallel algorithm for constructing succinct de Bruijn Graphs (SdBG), implemented on a graphical processing unit (GPU). The software has been well received by the assembly community, and there is interest in how to adapt the algorithms to integrate popular assembly practices so as to improve the assembly quality, as well as how to speed up the software using better CPU-based algorithms (instead of GPU). In this paper we first describe the details of the core algorithms in MEGAHIT v0.1, and then we show the new modules to upgrade MEGAHIT to version v1.0, which gives better assembly quality, runs faster and uses less memory. For the Iowa Prairie Soil dataset (252Gbp after quality trimming), the assembly quality of MEGAHIT v1.0, when compared with v0.1, has a significant improvement, namely, 36% increase in assembly size and 23% in N50. More interestingly, MEGAHIT v1.0 is no slower than before (even running with the extra modules). This is primarily due to a new CPU-based algorithm for SdBG construction that is faster and requires less memory. Using CPU only, MEGAHIT v1.0 can assemble the Iowa Prairie Soil sample in about 43h, reducing the running time of v0.1 by at least 25% and memory usage by up to 50%. MEGAHIT v1.0, exhibiting a smaller memory footprint, can process even larger datasets. The Kansas Prairie Soil sample (484Gbp), the largest publicly available dataset, can now be assembled using no more than 500GB of memory in 7.5days. The assemblies of these datasets (and other large metgenomic datasets), as well as the software, are available at the website https://hku-bal.github.io/megabox.},

abstract = {Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic following its initial emergence in China. Using next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced at an unprecedented rate and being deposited in public repositories. For the de novo assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a myriad of assemblers is being used, although their impact on the assembly quality has not been characterized for this virus. In this study, we aim to understand the variabilities on assembly qualities due to the choice of the assemblers. Results We performed 6,648 de novo assemblies of 416 SARS-CoV-2 samples using 8 different assemblers with different k-mers. We used Illumina paired-end sequencing reads and compared the genome assembly quality to that of different assemblers. We showed the choice of assemblers plays a significant role in reconstructing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Two metagenomic assemblers e.g. MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes performed better compared to others in most of the assembly quality metrics including, recovery of a larger fraction of the genome, constructing larger contigs and higher N50, NA50 values etc. We showed that at least 09% (259/2,873) of the variants present in the assemblies between MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes are unique to the assembly methods. Conclusion Our analyses indicate the critical role of assembly methods for assembling SARS-CoV-2 genome using short reads and their impact on variant characterization. This study could help guide future studies to determine which assembler is best suited for the de novo assembly of virus genomes.},

abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for contig binning only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species). In this paper, we introduce GraphBin2 which refines the binning results obtained from existing tools and, more importantly, is able to assign contigs to multiple bins. GraphBin2 uses the connectivity and coverage information from assembly graphs to adjust existing binning results on contigs and to infer contigs shared by multiple species. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that GraphBin2 not only improves binning results of existing tools but also supports to assign contigs to multiple bins. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Applied computing → Bioinformatics; Applied computing → Computational genomics},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
The field of metagenomics has provided valuable insights into the structure, diversity and ecology within microbial communities. One key step in metagenomics analysis is to assemble reads into longer contigs which are then binned into groups of contigs that belong to different species present in the metagenomic sample. Binning of contigs plays an important role in metagenomics and most available binning algorithms bin contigs using genomic features such as oligonucleotide/k-mer composition and contig coverage. As metagenomic contigs are derived from the assembly process, they are output from the underlying assembly graph which contains valuable connectivity information between contigs that can be used for binning.


RESULTS
We propose GraphBin, a new binning method that makes use of the assembly graph and applies a label propagation algorithm to refine the binning result of existing tools.We show that GraphBin can make use of the assembly graphs constructed from both the de Bruijn graph and the overlap-layout-consensus approach. Moreover, we demonstrate improved experimental results from GraphBin in terms of identifying mis-binned contigs and binning of contigs discarded by existing binning tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the information from the assembly graph has been used in a tool for the binning of metagenomic contigs.

abstract = {The assembly of high-quality genomes from mixed microbial samples is a long-standing challenge in genomics and metagenomics. Here, we describe the application of ProxiMeta, a Hi-C-based metagenomic deconvolution method, to deconvolve a human fecal metagenome. This method uses the intra-cellular proximity signal captured by Hi-C as a direct indicator of which sequences originated in the same cell, enabling culture-free de novo deconvolution of mixed genomes without any reliance on a priori information. We show that ProxiMeta deconvolution provides results of markedly high accuracy and sensitivity, yielding 50 near-complete microbial genomes (many of which are novel) from a single fecal sample, out of 252 total genome clusters. ProxiMeta outperforms traditional contig binning at high-quality genome reconstruction. ProxiMeta shows particularly good performance in constructing high-quality genomes for diverse but poorly-characterized members of the human gut. We further use ProxiMeta to reconstruct genome plasmid content and sharing of plasmids among genomes—tasks that traditional binning methods usually fail to accomplish. Our findings suggest that Hi-C-based deconvolution can be useful to a variety of applications in genomics and metagenomics.},

abstract = {Abstract NGS long-reads sequencing technologies (or third generation) such as Pacific BioSciences (PacBio) have revolutionized the sequencing field over the last decade improving multiple genomic applications like de novo genome assemblies. However, their error rate, mostly involving insertions and deletions (indels), is currently an important concern that requires special attention to be solved. Multiple algorithms are available to fix these sequencing errors using short reads (such as Illumina), although they require long processing times and some errors may persist. Here, we present Accurate long-Reads Assembly correction Method for Indel errorS (ARAMIS), the first NGS long-reads indels correction pipeline that combines several correction software in just one step using accurate short reads. As a proof OF concept, six organisms were selected based on their different GC content, size and genome complexity, and their PacBio-assembled genomes were corrected thoroughly by this pipeline. We found that the presence of systematic sequencing errors in long-reads PacBio sequences affecting homopolymeric regions, and that the type of indel error introduced during PacBio sequencing are related to the GC content of the organism. The lack of knowledge of this fact leads to the existence of numerous published studies where such errors have been found and should be resolved since they may contain incorrect biological information. ARAMIS yields better results with less computational resources needed than other correction tools and gives the possibility of detecting the nature of the found indel errors found and its distribution along the genome.

abstract = {BackgroundThe viral component of microbial communities plays a vital role in driving bacterial diversity, facilitating nutrient turnover and shaping community composition. Despite their importance, the vast majority of viral sequences are poorly annotated and share little or no homology to reference databases. As a result, investigation of the viral metagenome (virome) relies heavily on de novo assembly of short sequencing reads to recover compositional and functional information. Metagenomic assembly is particularly challenging for virome data, often resulting in fragmented assemblies and poor recovery of viral community members. Despite the essential role of assembly in virome analysis and difficulties posed by these data, current assembly comparisons have been limited to subsections of virome studies or bacterial datasets.DesignThis study presents the most comprehensive virome assembly comparison to date, featuring 16 metagenomic assembly approaches which have featured in human virome studies. Assemblers were assessed using four independent virome datasets, namely, simulated reads, two mock communities, viromes spiked with a known phage and human gut viromes.ResultsAssembly performance varied significantly across all test datasets, with SPAdes (meta) performing consistently well. Performance of MIRA and VICUNA varied, highlighting the importance of using a range of datasets when comparing assembly programs. It was also found that while some assemblers addressed the challenges of virome data better than others, all assemblers had limitations. Low read coverage and genomic repeats resulted in assemblies with poor genome recovery, high degrees of fragmentation and low-accuracy contigs across all assemblers. These limitations must be considered when setting thresholds for downstream analysis and when drawing conclusions from virome data.},

abstract = {In metagenomic studies of microbial communities, the short reads come from mixtures of genomes. Read assembly is usually an essential first step for the follow-up studies in metagenomic research. Understanding the power and limitations of various read assembly programs in practice is important for researchers to choose which programs to use in their investigations. Many studies evaluating different assembly programs used either simulated metagenomes or real metagenomes with unknown genome compositions. However, the simulated datasets may not reflect the real complexities of metagenomic samples and the estimated assembly accuracy could be misleading due to the unknown genomes in real metagenomes. Therefore, hybrid strategies are required to evaluate the various read assemblers for metagenomic studies. In this paper, we benchmark the metagenomic read assemblers by mixing reads from real metagenomic datasets with reads from known genomes and evaluating the integrity, contiguity and accuracy of the assembly using the reads from the known genomes. We selected four advanced metagenome assemblers, MEGAHIT, MetaSPAdes, IDBA-UD and Faucet, for evaluation. We showed the strengths and weaknesses of these assemblers in terms of integrity, contiguity and accuracy for different variables, including the genetic difference of the real genomes with the genome sequences in the real metagenomic datasets and the sequencing depth of the simulated datasets. Overall, MetaSPAdes performs best in terms of integrity and continuity at the species-level, followed by MEGAHIT. Faucet performs best in terms of accuracy at the cost of worst integrity and continuity, especially at low sequencing depth. MEGAHIT has the highest genome fractions at the strain-level and MetaSPAdes has the overall best performance at the strain-level. MEGAHIT is the most efficient in our experiments.

abstract = {Background: The recent release of the gene-targeted metagenomics assembler Xander has demonstrated that using the trained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to guide the traversal of de Bruijn graph gives obvious advantage over other assembly methods. Xander, as a pilot study, indeed has a lot of room for improvement. Apart from its slow speed, Xander uses only 1 k-mer size for graph construction and whatever choice of k will compromise either sensitivity or accuracy. Xander uses a Bloom-filter representation of de Bruijn graph to achieve a lower memory footprint. Bloom filters bring in false positives, and it is not clear how this would impact the quality of assembly. Xander does not keep track of the multiplicity of k-mers, which would have been an effective way to differentiate between erroneous k-mers and correct k-mers. Results: In this paper, we present a new gene-targeted assembler MegaGTA, which attempts to improve Xander in different aspects. Quality-wise, it utilizes iterative de Bruijn graphs to take full advantage of multiple k-mer sizes to make the best of both sensitivity and accuracy. Computation-wise, it employs succinct de Bruijn graphs (SdBG) to achieve low memory footprint and high speed (the latter is benefited from a highly efficient parallel algorithm for constructing SdBG). Unlike Bloom filters, an SdBG is an exact representation of a de Bruijn graph. It enables MegaGTA to avoid false-positive contigs and to easily incorporate the multiplicity of k-mers for building better HMM model. We have compared MegaGTA and Xander on an HMP-defined mock metagenomic dataset, and showed that MegaGTA excelled in both sensitivity and accuracy. On a large rhizosphere soil metagenomic sample (327Gbp), MegaGTA produced 9.7–19.3% more contigs than Xander, and these contigs were assigned to 10–25% more gene references. In our experiments, MegaGTA, depending on the number of k-mers used, is two to ten times faster than Xander. Conclusion: MegaGTA improves on the algorithm of Xander and achieves higher sensitivity, accuracy and speed. Moreover, it is capable of assembling gene sequences from ultra-large metagenomic datasets. Its source code is freely available at https://github.com/HKU-BAL/megagta .},

abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing the field of biology and metagenomic-based research. Since the volume of metagenomic data is typically very large, De novo metagenomic assembly can be effectively used to reduce the total amount of data and enhance quality of downstream analysis, such as annotation and binning. Although, there are many freely available assemblers, but selecting one suitable for a specific goal can be highly challenging. In this study, the performance of 11 well-known assemblers was evaluated in the assembly of three different metagenomes. The results obtained show that metaSPAdes is the best assembler and Megahit is a good choice for conservative assembly strategy. In addition, this research provides useful information regarding the pros and cons of each assembler and the effect of read length on assembly, thereby helping scholars to select the optimal assembler based on their objectives.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Functional potential of genomes and metagenomes which are inferred using homology based methods are often subjected to certain limitations, especially for proteins with homologs which function in multiple pathways. Augmenting the homology information with genomic location of the constituent genes can significantly improve the accuracy of estimated functions. This can help in distinguishing cognate homolog belonging to a candidate pathway from its other homologs functional in different pathways.


RESULTS
In this paper, we present a web-based analysis platform 'FunGeCo' to enable gene-context based functional inference for microbial genomes and metagenomes. It is expected to be a valuable resource and complement the existing tools for understanding the functional potential of microbes which reside in an environment.

abstract = {Motivation The biases in Open Reading Frame (ORF) prediction tools, which have been based on historic genomic annotations from model organisms, impact our understanding of novel genomes and metagenomes. This hinders the discovery of new genomic information as it results in predictions being biased towards existing knowledge. To date users have lacked a systematic and replicable approach to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any ORF prediction tool and allow them to choose the right tool for their analysis. Results We present an evaluation framework (ORForise) based on a comprehensive set of 12 primary and 60 secondary metrics that facilitate the assessment of the performance of ORF prediction tools. This makes it possible to identify which performs better for specific use-cases. We use this to assess 15 ab initio and model-based tools representing those most widely used (historically and currently) to generate the knowledge in genomic databases. We find that the performance of any tool is dependent on the genome being analysed, and no individual tool ranked as the most accurate across all genomes or metrics analysed. Even the top-ranked tools produced conflicting gene collections which could not be resolved by aggregation. The ORForise evaluation framework provides users with a replicable, data-led approach to make informed tool choices for novel genome annotations and for refining historical annotations.

abstract = {Characterizing the complete genomic structure of complex microbial communities would represent a key step toward the understanding of their diversity, dynamics, and evolution. Current metagenomics approaches aiming at this goal are typically done by analyzing millions of short DNA sequences directly extracted from the environment. New experimental and computational approaches are constantly sought for to improve the analysis and interpretation of such data. We developed MetaTOR, an open-source computational solution that bins DNA contigs into individual genomes according to their 3D contact frequencies. Those contacts are quantified by chromosome conformation capture experiments (3C, Hi-C), also known as proximity-ligation approaches, applied to metagenomics samples (meta3C). MetaTOR was applied on 20 meta3C libraries of mice gut microbiota. We quantified the program ability to recover high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from metagenomic assemblies generated directly from the meta3C libraries. Whereas nine high-quality MAGs are identified in the 148-Mb assembly generated using a single meta3C library, MetaTOR identifies 82 high-quality MAGs in the 763-Mb assembly generated from the merged 20 meta3C libraries, corresponding to nearly a third of the total assembly. Compared to the hybrid binning softwares MetaBAT or CONCOCT, MetaTOR recovered three times more high-quality MAGs. These results underline the potential of 3C-/Hi-C-based approaches in metagenomic projects.},

abstract = {BackgroundNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly facilitated metagenomic analysis but also raised new challenges for metagenomic DNA sequence assembly, owing to its high-throughput nature and extremely short reads generated by sequencers such as Illumina. To date, how to generate a high-quality draft assembly for metagenomic sequencing projects has not been fully addressed.ResultsWe conducted a comprehensive assessment on state-of-the-art de novo assemblers and revealed that the performance of each assembler depends critically on the sequencing depth. To address this problem, we developed a pipeline named InteMAP to integrate three assemblers, ABySS, IDBA-UD and CABOG, which were found to complement each other in assembling metagenomic sequences. Making a decision of which assembling approaches to use according to the sequencing coverage estimation algorithm for each short read, the pipeline presents an automatic platform suitable to assemble real metagenomic NGS data with uneven coverage distribution of sequencing depth. By comparing the performance of InteMAP with current assemblers on both synthetic and real NGS metagenomic data, we demonstrated that InteMAP achieves better performance with a longer total contig length and higher contiguity, and contains more genes than others.ConclusionsWe developed a de novo pipeline, named InteMAP, that integrates existing tools for metagenomics assembly. The pipeline outperforms previous assembly methods on metagenomic assembly by providing a longer total contig length, a higher contiguity and covering more genes. InteMAP, therefore, could potentially be a useful tool for the research community of metagenomics.},

abstract = {Our understanding of natural microbial communities is shaped by the careful investigation of a relatively small number of isolated and cultured organisms, and by analysis of genomic sequences obtained by culture-free metagenomic sequencing approaches. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing has facilitated partial reconstruction of strain-level community structure and functional repertoire. Unfortunately, it remains difficult to cost-effectively produce high quality genome drafts for individual microbes without isolation and culture. Recent molecular techniques that partition long DNA fragments and then barcode short fragments derived from them produce “read clouds”, which are short-read sequences containing long-range information. Here, we present a novel application of a read cloud technique to microbiome samples, as well as Athena, a de novo assembler that uses these barcodes to produce improved metagenomic assemblies. We apply our approach to sequence human stool samples from two healthy individuals, and compare it to existing short read and synthetic long read metagenomic sequencing approaches. We find that read cloud metagenomic sequencing and Athena assembly produce the most complete individual genome drafts. These genome drafts are also highly contiguous (>200kb N50, <10 contigs), even for bacteria that have relatively low (20x) raw short read sequence coverage. We also apply this approach to a significantly more complex marine sediment sample and obtain 23 genome drafts with valuable 16S ribosomal RNA taxonomic marker sequences, nine of which are complete genome drafts. Read cloud metagenomic sequencing allows culture-free generation of high quality microbial genome drafts using only a single shotgun experiment.},

abstract = {Motivation Due to the complexity of metagenomic community, de novo assembly on next generation sequencing data is commonly unable to produce microbial complete genomes. Metagenomic binning is a crucial task that could group the fragmented contigs into clusters based on their nucleotide compositions and read depths. These features work well on the long contigs, but are not stable for the short ones. Assembly and paired-end graphs can provide the connectedness between contigs, where the linked contigs have high chance to be derived from the same clusters. Results We developed METAMVGL, a multi-view graph-based metagenomic contig binning algorithm by integrating both assembly and paired-end graphs. It could strikingly rescue the short contigs and correct the binning errors from dead ends subgraphs. METAMVGL could learn the graphs’ weights automatically and predict the contig labels in a uniform multi-view label propagation framework. In the experiments, we observed METAMVGL significantly increased the high-confident edges in the combined graph and linked dead ends to the main graph. It also outperformed with many state-of-the-art binning methods, MaxBin2, MetaBAT2, MyCC, CONCOCT, SolidBin and Graphbin on the metagenomic sequencing from simulation, two mock communities and real Sharon data.

abstract = {Background Although the total number of microbial taxa on Earth is under debate, it is clear that only a small fraction of these has been cultivated and validly named. Evidently, the inability to culture most bacteria outside of very specific conditions severely limits their characterization and further studies. In the last decade, a major part of the solution to this problem has been the use of metagenome sequencing, whereby the DNA of an entire microbial community is sequenced, followed by the in silico reconstruction of genomes of its novel component species. The large discrepancy between the number of sequenced type strain genomes (around 12,000) and total microbial diversity (10 6 –10 12 species) directs these efforts to de novo assembly and binning. Unfortunately, these steps are error-prone and as such, the results have to be intensely scrutinized to avoid publishing incomplete and low-quality genomes. Results We developed MAGISTA (metagenome-assembled genome intra-bin statistics assessment), a novel approach to assess metagenome-assembled genome quality that tackles some of the often-neglected drawbacks of current reference gene-based methods. MAGISTA is based on alignment-free distance distributions between contig fragments within metagenomic bins, rather than a set of reference genes. For proper training, a highly complex genomic DNA mock community was needed and constructed by pooling genomic DNA of 227 bacterial strains, specifically selected to obtain a wide variety representing the major phylogenetic lineages of cultivable bacteria. Conclusions MAGISTA achieved a 20% reduction in root-mean-square error in comparison to the marker gene approach when tested on publicly available mock metagenomes. Furthermore, our highly complex genomic DNA mock community is a very valuable tool for benchmarking (new) metagenome analysis methods.},

Many variants of these protocols have been developed, each with their own strengths. Currently there is no systematic means for simulating sequence data from this family of sequencing protocols. Findings We describe a computational simulator that, given reference genome sequences and some basic parameters, will simulate HiC sequencing on those sequences. The simulator models the basic spatial structure in genomes that is commonly observed in HiC and 3C datasets, including the distance-decay relationship in proximity ligation, differences in the frequency of interaction within and across chromosomes, and the structure imposed by cells. A means to model the 3D structure of topologically associating domains (TADs) is provided. The simulator also models several sources of error common to 3C and HiC library preparation and sequencing methods, including spurious proximity ligation events and sequencing error. Conclusions We have introduced the first comprehensive simulator for 3C and HiC sequencing protocols. We expect the simulator to have use in testing of HiC data analysis algorithms, as well as more general value for experimental design, where questions such as the required depth of sequencing, enzyme choice, and other decisions must be made in advance in order to ensure adequate statistical power to test the relevant hypotheses.},

abstract = {The theory of kin selection is the framework to explain the evolution of social interactions that abound across the diversity of life (1). Observing cooperative behavior posed a challenge to Darwin, but with social insects in mind he proposed that natural selection at the fam-ily level can favor helping relatives reproduce (2). His ideas, and the work of Price, built the foundation for Hamilton ’ s rule, stating that the cost of helping others, in terms of lost reproductive output, may be offset if help is directed toward increasing reproduction of suf-ficiently close relatives. As such, the investment in passing on genes through relatives contributes to the inclusive fitness of an organism (3). The stark divi-sion of labor in some social insects, between sterile workers and reproductive royals, in particular begged an explanation that kin selection provided. kin selection to explain cooperative behaviors in mammals, birds, algae, and microbes Estimating and analyzing inclusive fitness effects of social traits and applying concepts from kin selection requires the estimation of relatedness between actors and recipients — a challenge in complex microbial communities. In PNAS, Simonet and McNally (5) propose an approach based on the analysis of metagenomes in fecal microbiomes from healthy donors. Their work opens a frontier for kin selection theory by exploring the associations between relatedness and cooperative trait distributions in human gut bacteria.},

abstract = {Most microbes inhabiting the planet cannot be easily grown in the lab. Metagenomic techniques provide a means to study these organisms, and recent advances in the field have enabled the resolution of individual genomes from metagenomes, so-called Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs). In addition to expanding the catalog of known microbial diversity, the systematic retrieval of MAGs stands as a tenable divide and conquer reduction of metagenome analysis to the simpler problem of single genome analysis. Many leading approaches to MAG retrieval depend upon time-series or transect data, whose effectiveness is a function of community complexity, target abundance and depth of sequencing. Without the need for time-series data, promising alternative methods are based upon the high-throughput sequencing technique called Hi-C. The Hi-C technique produces read-pairs which capture in-vivo DNA-DNA proximity interactions (contacts). The physical structure of the community modulates the signal derived from these interactions and a hierarchy of interaction rates exists (īntra-chromosomal > Inter-chromosomal > Inter-cellular). We describe an unsupervised method that exploits the hierarchical nature of Hi-C interaction rates to resolve MAGs from a single time-point. As a quantitative demonstration, next, we validate the method against the ground truth of a simulated human faecal microbiome. Lastly, we directly compare our method against a recently announced proprietary service ProxiMeta, which also performs MAG retrieval using Hi-C data. bin3C has been implemented as a simple open-source pipeline and makes use of the unsupervised community detection algorithm Infomap (https://github.com/cerebis/bin3C).},

abstract = {High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) has recently been applied to natural microbial communities and revealed great potential to study multiple genomes simultaneously. Several extraneous factors may influence chromosomal contacts rendering the normalization of Hi-C contact maps essential for downstream analyses. However, the current paucity of metagenomic Hi-C normalization methods and the ignorance for spurious inter-species contacts weaken the interpretability of the data. Here, we report on two types of biases in metagenomic Hi-C experiments: explicit biases and implicit biases, and introduce HiCzin, a parametric model to correct both types of biases and remove spurious inter-species contacts. We demonstrate that the normalized metagenomic Hi-C contact maps by HiCzin result in lower biases, higher capability to detect spurious contacts, and better performance in metagenomic contig clustering.

abstract = {BackgroundThe recent release of the gene-targeted metagenomics assembler Xander has demonstrated that using the trained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to guide the traversal of de Bruijn graph gives obvious advantage over other assembly methods. Xander, as a pilot study, indeed has a lot of room for improvement. Apart from its slow speed, Xander uses only 1 k-mer size for graph construction and whatever choice of k will compromise either sensitivity or accuracy. Xander uses a Bloom-filter representation of de Bruijn graph to achieve a lower memory footprint. Bloom filters bring in false positives, and it is not clear how this would impact the quality of assembly. Xander does not keep track of the multiplicity of k-mers, which would have been an effective way to differentiate between erroneous k-mers and correct k-mers.ResultsIn this paper, we present a new gene-targeted assembler MegaGTA, which attempts to improve Xander in different aspects. Quality-wise, it utilizes iterative de Bruijn graphs to take full advantage of multiple k-mer sizes to make the best of both sensitivity and accuracy. Computation-wise, it employs succinct de Bruijn graphs (SdBG) to achieve low memory footprint and high speed (the latter is benefited from a highly efficient parallel algorithm for constructing SdBG). Unlike Bloom filters, an SdBG is an exact representation of a de Bruijn graph. It enables MegaGTA to avoid false-positive contigs and to easily incorporate the multiplicity of k-mers for building better HMM model.We have compared MegaGTA and Xander on an HMP-defined mock metagenomic dataset, and showed that MegaGTA excelled in both sensitivity and accuracy. On a large rhizosphere soil metagenomic sample (327Gbp), MegaGTA produced 9.7–19.3% more contigs than Xander, and these contigs were assigned to 10–25% more gene references. In our experiments, MegaGTA, depending on the number of k-mers used, is two to ten times faster than Xander.ConclusionMegaGTA improves on the algorithm of Xander and achieves higher sensitivity, accuracy and speed. Moreover, it is capable of assembling gene sequences from ultra-large metagenomic datasets. Its source code is freely available at https://github.com/HKU-BAL/megagta .},

abstract = {The recent development of metagenomic assembly has revolutionized metagenomic data analysis, thanks to the improvement of sequencing techniques, more powerful computational infrastructure and the development of novel algorithms and methods. Using longer assembled contigs rather than raw reads improves the process of metagenomic binning and annotation significantly, ultimately resulting in a deeper understanding of the microbial dynamics of the metagenomic samples being analyzed. In this chapter, we demonstrate a typical metagenomic analysis pipeline including raw read quality evaluation and trimming, assembly and contig binning. Alternative tools that can be used for each step are also discussed.},

While database driven approaches have been employed in certain analyses, they have not been used in the assembly of metagenomes. Here we describe the first effective approach for reference-guided metagenomic assembly of low-abundance bacterial genomes that can complement and improve upon de novo metagenomic assembly methods. When combined with de novo assembly approaches, we show that MetaCompass can generate more complete assemblies than can be obtained by de novo assembly alone, and improve on assemblies from the Human Microbiome Project (over 2,000 samples).},

abstract = {Abstract Motivation The biases in CoDing Sequence (CDS) prediction tools, which have been based on historic genomic annotations from model organisms, impact our understanding of novel genomes and metagenomes. This hinders the discovery of new genomic information as it results in predictions being biased towards existing knowledge. To date, users have lacked a systematic and replicable approach to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any CDS prediction tool and allow them to choose the right tool for their analysis. Results We present an evaluation framework (ORForise) based on a comprehensive set of 12 primary and 60 secondary metrics that facilitate the assessment of the performance of CDS prediction tools. This makes it possible to identify which performs better for specific use-cases. We use this to assess 15 ab initio- and model-based tools representing those most widely used (historically and currently) to generate the knowledge in genomic databases. We find that the performance of any tool is dependent on the genome being analysed, and no individual tool ranked as the most accurate across all genomes or metrics analysed. Even the top-ranked tools produced conflicting gene collections, which could not be resolved by aggregation. The ORForise evaluation framework provides users with a replicable, data-led approach to make informed tool choices for novel genome annotations and for refining historical annotations. Availability and implementation Code and datasets for reproduction and customisation are available at https://github.com/NickJD/ORForise.
