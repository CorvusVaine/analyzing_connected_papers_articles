abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in deep learning with neural networks, has made a profound impact on fields such as natural language processing, image classification, and language modeling; however, feasibility and potential benefits of the approaches to metagenomic data analysis has been largely under-explored. Deep learning exploits many layers of learning nonlinear feature representations, typically in an unsupervised fashion, and recent results have shown outstanding generalization performance on previously unseen data. Furthermore, some deep learning methods can also represent the structure in a data set. Consequently, deep learning and neural networks may prove to be an appropriate approach for metagenomic data. To determine whether such approaches are indeed appropriate for metagenomics, we experiment with two deep learning methods: i) a deep belief network, and ii) a recursive neural network, the latter of which provides a tree representing the structure of the data. We compare these approaches to the standard multi-layer perceptron, which has been well-established in the machine learning community as a powerful prediction algorithm, though its presence is largely missing in metagenomics literature. We find that traditional neural networks can be quite powerful classifiers on metagenomic data compared to baseline methods, such as random forests. On the other hand, while the deep learning approaches did not result in improvements to the classification accuracy, they do provide the ability to learn hierarchical representations of a data set that standard classification methods do not allow. Our goal in this effort is not to determine the best algorithm in terms accuracy-as that depends on the specific application-but rather to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of each of the approach we discuss and provide insight on how they can be improved for predictive metagenomic analysis.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing techniques have made large-scale spatial and temporal surveys of microbial communities routine. Gaining insight into microbial diversity requires methods for effectively analyzing and visualizing these extensive data sets. Phylogenetic β-diversity measures address this challenge by allowing the relationship between large numbers of environmental samples to be explored using standard multivariate analysis techniques. Despite the success and widespread use of phylogenetic β-diversity measures, an extensive comparative analysis of these measures has not been performed. Here, we compare 39 measures of phylogenetic β diversity in order to establish the relative similarity of these measures along with key properties and performance characteristics. While many measures are highly correlated, those commonly used within microbial ecology were found to be distinct from those popular within classical ecology, and from the recently recommended Gower and Canberra measures. Many of the measures are surprisingly robust to different rootings of the gene tree, the choice of similarity threshold used to define operational taxonomic units, and the presence of outlying basal lineages. Measures differ considerably in their sensitivity to rare organisms, and the effectiveness of measures can vary substantially under alternative models of differentiation. Consequently, the depth of sequencing required to reveal underlying patterns of relationships between environmental samples depends on the selected measure. Our results demonstrate that using complementary measures of phylogenetic β diversity can further our understanding of how communities are phylogenetically differentiated. Open-source software implementing the phylogenetic β-diversity measures evaluated in this manuscript is available at http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/ExpressBetaDiversity.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have had unprecedented success when applied to images, waveforms, and texts to cite a few. In general, when the sample size (N) is much greater than the number of features (d), DL outperforms previous machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of convolution neural networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics ML tasks, we encounter the opposite situation where d is greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques (such as feed-forward networks) would lead to severe overfitting. Thus, sparse ML techniques (such as LASSO e.g.) usually yield the best results on these tasks. In this paper, we show how to apply CNNs on data which do not have originally an image structure (in particular on metagenomic data). Our first contribution is to show how to map metagenomic data in a meaningful way to 1D or 2D images. Based on this representation, we then apply a CNN, with the aim of predicting various diseases. The proposed approach is applied on six different datasets including in total over 1000 samples from various diseases. This approach could be a promising one for prediction tasks in the bioinformatics field.},

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.},

abstract = {Feature subset selection is an important step towards producing a classifier that relies only on relevant features, while keeping the computational complexity of the classifier low. Feature selection is also used in making inferences on the importance of attributes, even when classification is not the ultimate goal. For example, in bioinformatics and genomics feature subset selection is used to make inferences between the variables that best describe multiple populations. Unfortunately, many feature selection algorithms require the subset size to be specified a priori, but knowing how many variables to select is typically a nontrivial task. Other approaches rely on a specific variable subset selection framework to be used. In this work, we examine an approach to feature subset selection works with a generic variable selection algorithm, and our approach provides statistical inference on the number of features that are relevant, which may be unknown to the generic variable selection algorithm. This work extends our previous implementation of a Neyman-Pearson feature selection (NPFS) hypothesis test, which acts as a meta-subset selection algorithm. Specifically, we examine the conservativeness of the NPFS approach by biasing the hypothesis test, and examine other heuristics for NPFS. We include results from carefully designed synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the NPFS's ability to perform on data of a massive scale.},

Conditions in the microbiome have been linked to a number of significant diseases. Additionally, revolutions in sequencing technology have led to a rapid increase in publicly-available sequencing data. Consequently, there have been growing efforts to predict disease status from metagenomic sequencing data, with a proliferation of new approaches in the last few years. Some of these efforts have explored utilizing a powerful form of machine learning called deep learning, which has been applied successfully in several biological domains. Here, we review some of these methods and the algorithms that they are based on, with a particular focus on deep learning methods.

abstract = {Background The advance of metagenomic studies provides the opportunity to identify microbial taxa that are associated to human diseases. Multiple methods exist for the association analysis. However, the results could be inconsistent, presenting challenges in interpreting the host-microbiome interactions. To address this issue, we introduce Meta-Signer, a novel Metagenomic Signature Identifier tool based on rank aggregation of features identified from multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, LASSO, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, and our recently developed Convolutional Neural Network framework (PopPhy-CNN). Meta-Signer generates ranked taxa lists by training individual machine learning models over multiple training partitions and aggregates them into a single ranked list by an optimization procedure to represent the most informative and robust microbial features. Meta-Signer can rank taxa using two input forms of the data: the relative abundances of the original taxa and taxa from the populated taxonomic trees generated from the original taxa. The latter form allows the evaluation of the association of microbial features at different taxonomic levels to the disease, which is attributed to our novel model of PopPhy-CNN. Results We evaluate Mega-Signer on five different human gut-microbiome datasets. We demonstrate that the features derived from Meta-Signer were more informative compared to those obtained from other available feature ranking methods. The highly ranked features are strongly supported by published literature. Conclusion Meta-Signer is capable of deriving a robust set of microbial features at multiple taxonomic levels for the prediction of host phenotype. Meta-Signer is user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to explore their datasets quickly and efficiently.},

abstract = {Examining the bacterial or functional differences between multiple habitats/populations/phenotypes plays an important role in making inferences about the roles that the taxonomy and functional profiles can take on in microbial ecology. It is therefore important to the field of comparative metagenomics, using α- & β-diversity, that methods or algorithms can detect the importance of particular subsets of variables that best differentiate the multiple phenotypes in the data. Given todays genomic data deluge efficient methods that can carry out these inferences cannot be understated enough. We assume observations are collected from a multitude of different environments (e.g., males vs. females, control vs. stimulus, etc.), and each observation is comprised of hundreds or thousands of different taxa/functional features (i.e., 16S or whole genome shotgun). Our goal in this work is to examine the role, assumptions, and inferences that feature subset selection can provide the field of microbial ecology and comparative metagenomics. Specifically we examine feature subset selection algorithms using embedded and filter approaches to infer taxa importance on data collected from the human gut microbiome We compare several widely adopted approaches from machine learning including greedy algorithms and l1 regularization methods, as well as some software tools provided with QIIME, on data collected from the American Gut Project and other canonical studies of the human gut microbiome. We find that there are very few OTUs that carry information in regards to predicting the sex of a gut sample, and that Bacteroidetes is quite frequently found in the top ranked OTUs.},

In this review, we demonstrate that several existing supervised classifiers can be applied effectively to microbiota classification, both for selecting subsets of taxa that are highly discriminative of the type of community, and for building models that can accurately classify unlabeled data.

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular deep learning architecture widely applied in different domains, in particular in classifying over images, for which the concept of convolution with a filter comes naturally. Unfortunately, the requirement of a distance (or, at least, of a neighbourhood function) in the input feature space has so far prevented its direct use on data types such as omics data. However, a number of omics data are metrizable, i.e., they can be endowed with a metric structure, enabling to adopt a convolutional based deep learning framework, e.g., for prediction. We propose a generalized solution for CNNs on omics data, implemented through a dedicated Keras layer. In particular, for metagenomics data, a metric can be derived from the patristic distance on the phylogenetic tree. For transcriptomics data, we combine Gene Ontology semantic similarity and gene co-expression to define a distance; the function is defined through a multilayer network where 3 layers are defined by the GO mutual semantic similarity while the fourth one by gene co-expression. As a general tool, feature distance on omics data is enabled by OmicsConv, a novel Keras layer, obtaining OmicsCNN, a dedicated deep learning framework. Here we demonstrate OmicsCNN on gut microbiota sequencing data, for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 16S data, first on synthetic data and then a metagenomics collection of gut microbiota of 222 IBD patients.},

abstract = {BackgroundWhat is a healthy microbiome? The pursuit of this and many related questions, especially in light of the recently recognized microbial component in a wide range of diseases has sparked a surge in metagenomic studies. They are often not simply attributable to a single pathogen but rather are the result of complex ecological processes. Relatedly, the increasing DNA sequencing depth and number of samples in metagenomic case-control studies enabled the applicability of powerful statistical methods, e.g. Machine Learning approaches. For the latter, the feature space is typically shaped by the relative abundances of operational taxonomic units, as determined by cost-effective phylogenetic marker gene profiles. While a substantial body of microbiome/microbiota research involves unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning, very little attention has been put on feature selection and engineering.ResultsWe here propose the first algorithm to exploit phylogenetic hierarchy (i.e. an all-encompassing taxonomy) in feature engineering for microbiota classification. The rationale is to exploit the often mono- or oligophyletic distribution of relevant (but hidden) traits by virtue of taxonomic abstraction. The algorithm is embedded in a comprehensive microbiota classification pipeline, which we applied to a diverse range of datasets, distinguishing healthy from diseased microbiota samples.ConclusionWe demonstrate substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art microbiota classification tools in terms of classification accuracy, regardless of the actual Machine Learning technique while using drastically reduced feature spaces. Moreover, generalized features bear great explanatory value: they provide a concise description of conditions and thus help to provide pathophysiological insights. Indeed, the automatically and reproducibly derived features are consistent with previously published domain expert analyses.},

abstract = {Human-associated microbial communities have been implicated in a variety of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, and autoimmune disorders like diabetes. Environmental communities are also important for bioconversion of waste products in biofuel production. However, microbiomes are highly complex systems involving mutualism and competition between many constituent organisms, and a variety of fundamental and interesting computational challenges remain in the modeling of pathogenicity and community-wide response to perturbations. In this thesis we discuss several computational and statistical approaches to predictive modeling of microbiome behavior using high-throughput metagenomic and transcriptomic sequencing data, including models that leverage biological structures such as phylogenies and gene ontologies to help extract features and constrain model complexity. We also demonstrate several applications of these approaches to real biological problems. 
We successfully apply predictive modeling to new studies of human-associated and environmental microbial communities in several interdisciplinary collaborations with colleagues at numerous institutions around the world. These include a prominent study of the species and genes present in diverse mammalian gut communities, a study of the effects of yogurt consumption on gut microbial taxa and gene expression (i.e. transcriptomics) in humans and mice, and a large cross-sectional global survey of the human gut microbiota in varied populations. We also develop SourceTracker, a Bayesian approach to predictive modeling of mixtures of microbial communities with important applications in forensics, pollution studies, public health, and detection of sample contamination. 
This dissertation introduces predictive modeling of human-associated and environmental microbial communities, increasing our ability to understanding the diversity and distribution of the human microbiota, and especially the systematic changes that occur in different physiological and disease states. We expect this type of predictive modeling to have far-reaching effects on health and disease.},

Machine-learning procedures have been used in the past for supervised classification, but increased attention to feature representation and selection may produce better models and predictions.ResultsWe focused our attention on the classification of nine oral sites and dental plaque in particular, using data collected from the Human Microbiome Project. A key focus of our representations was the use of phylogenetic information, both as the basis for custom kernels and as a way to represent sets of microbes to the classifier. We also used the PICRUSt software, which draws on phylogenetic relationships to predict molecular functions and to generate additional features for the classifier. Custom kernels based on the UniFrac measure of community dissimilarity did not improve performance. However, feature representation was vital to classification accuracy, with microbial clade and function representations providing useful information to the classifier; combining the two types of features did not yield increased prediction accuracy. Many of the best-performing clades and functions had clear associations with oral microflora.ConclusionsThe classification of oral microbiota remains a challenging problem; our best accuracy on the plaque dataset was approximately 81 %. Perfect accuracy may be unattainable due to the close proximity of the sites and intra-individual variation. However, further exploration of the space of both classifiers and feature representations is likely to increase the accuracy of predictive models.},

abstract = {The microbiome has been shown to have an impact on the development of various diseases in the host. Being able to make an accurate prediction of the phenotype of a genomic sample based on its microbial taxonomic abundance profile is an important problem for personalized medicine. In this paper, we examine the potential of using a deep learning framework, a convolutional neural network (CNN), for such a prediction. To facilitate the CNN learning, we explore the structure of abundance profiles by creating the phylogenetic tree and by designing a scheme to embed the tree to a matrix that retains the spatial relationship of nodes in the tree and their quantitative characteristics. The proposed CNN framework is highly accurate, achieving a 99.47% of accuracy based on the evaluation on a dataset 1967 samples of three phenotypes. Our result demonstrated the feasibility and promising aspect of CNN in the classification of sample phenotype.},

abstract = {Feature selection is an important step in data analysis to address the curse of dimensionality. Such dimensionality reduction techniques are particularly important when if a classification is required and the model scales in polynomial time with the size of the feature (e.g., some applications include genomics, life sciences, cyber-security, etc.). Feature selection is the process of finding the minimum subset of features that allows for the maximum predictive power. Many of the state-of-the-art information-theoretic feature selection approaches use a greedy forward search; however, there are concerns with the search in regards to the efficiency and optimality. A unified framework was recently presented for information-theoretic feature selection that tied together many of the works in over the past twenty years. The work showed that joint mutual information maximization (JMI) is generally the best options; however, the complexity of greedy search for JMI scales quadratically and it is infeasible on high dimensional datasets. In this contribution, we propose a fast approximation of JMI based on information theory. Our approach takes advantage of decomposing the calculations within JMI to speed up a typical greedy search. We benchmarked the proposed approach against JMI on several UCI datasets, and we demonstrate that the proposed approach returns feature sets that are highly consistent with JMI, while decreasing the run time required to perform feature selection.},

It was recently discovered that microbial communities can be exploited for forensic identification by clustering samples from individual's skin and objects that they may have previously touched. Typically, this is done by using basic multi-dimensional scaling analysis using phylogenetic distances.

abstract = {Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

abstract = {Increasingly, many machine learning applications are now associated with very large data sets whose sizes were almost unimaginable just a short time ago. As a result, many of the current algorithms cannot handle, or do not scale to, today’s extremely large volumes of data. Fortunately, not all features that make up a typical data set carry information that is relevant or useful for prediction, and identifying and removing such irrelevant features can significantly reduce the total data size. The unfortunate dilemma, however, is that some of the current data sets are so large that common feature selection algorithms—whose very goal is to reduce the dimensionality—cannot handle such large data sets, creating a vicious cycle. We describe a sequential learning framework for feature subset selection (SLSS) that can scale with both the number of features and the number of observations. The proposed framework uses multiarm bandit algorithms to sequentially search a subset of variables, and assign a level of importance for each feature. The novel contribution of SLSS is its ability to naturally scale to large data sets, evaluate such data in a very small amount of time, and be performed independently of the optimization of any classifier to reduce unnecessary complexity. We demonstrate the capabilities of SLSS on synthetic and real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Increasingly many applications of machine learning are encountering large data that were almost unimaginable just a few years ago, and hence, many of the current algorithms cannot handle, i.e., do not scale to, today’s extremely large volumes of data. The data are made up of a large set of features describing each observation, and the complexity of the models for making predictions tend to increase not only with the number of observations, but also the number of features. Fortunately, not all of the features that make up the data carry meaningful information about making the predictions. Thus irrelevant features should be filtered from the data prior to building a model. Such a process of removing features to produce a subset is commonly referred to as feature subset selection. In this work, we present two new filter-based feature subset selection algorithms that are scalable to large data sets that address: (i) potentially large & distributed data sets, and (ii) they are capable of scaling to very large feature sets. Our first proposed algorithm, Neyman-Pearson Feature Selection (NPFS), uses a statistical hypothesis test derived from the Neyman-Pearson lemma for determining if a feature is statistically relevant. The proposed approach can be applied as a wrapper to any feature selection algorithm, regardless of the feature selection criteria used, to determine whether a feature belongs in the relevant set. Perhaps more importantly, this procedure efficiently determines the number of relevant features given an initial starting point, and it fits into a computationally attractive MapReduce model. We also describe a sequential learning framework for feature subset selection (SLSS) that scales with both the number of features as well},

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of various biosystems, ranging from the human body to the environment. A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes. Results k-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed the computationally costly Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking, and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments, and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87. For large datasets, deep learning outperformed classical methods such as Random Forest and SVM. Availability The software and datasets are available at https://llp.berkeley.edu/micropheno.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown unprecedented success when applied to images, waveforms, and text. Generally, when the sample size (N) is much bigger than the number of features (d), DL often out-performs other machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics fields (including metagenomics), we encounter the opposite situation where d is significantly greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques would lead to severe over-fitting. Here we aim to improve classification of various diseases with metagenomic data through the use of CNNs. For this we proposed to represent metagenomic data as images. The proposed Met2Img approach relies on taxonomic and t-SNE embeddings to transform abundance data into " synthetic images ". We applied our approach to twelve benchmark data sets including more than 1400 metagenomic samples. Our results show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). We observe that the integration of phylogenetic information alongside abundance data improves classification. The proposed approach is not only important in classification setting but also allows to visualize complex metagenomic data. The Met2Img is implemented in Python.},

abstract = {Metagenomics is revolutionizing our understanding of microbial communities, showing that their structure and composition have profound effects on the ecosystem and in a variety of health and disease conditions. Despite the flourishing of new analysis methods, current approaches based on statistical comparisons between high-level taxonomic classes often fail to identify the microbial taxa that are differentially distributed between sets of samples, since in many cases the taxonomic schema do not allow an adequate description of the structure of the microbiota. This constitutes a severe limitation to the use of metagenomic data in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. To provide a more robust statistical framework, we introduce a class of feature-weighting algorithms that discriminate the taxa responsible for the classification of metagenomic samples. The method unambiguously groups the relevant taxa into clades without relying on pre-defined taxonomic categories, thus including in the analysis also those sequences for which a taxonomic classification is difficult. The phylogenetic clades are weighted and ranked according to their abundance measuring their contribution to the differentiation of the classes of samples, and a criterion is provided to define a reduced set of most relevant clades. Applying the method to public datasets, we show that the data-driven definition of relevant phylogenetic clades accomplished by our ranking strategy identifies features in the samples that are lost if phylogenetic relationships are not considered, improving our ability to mine metagenomic datasets. Comparison with supervised classification methods currently used in metagenomic data analysis highlights the advantages of using phylogenetic information.},

abstract = {Background: Some of the current software tools for comparative metagenomics provide ecologists with the ability to investigate and explore bacterial communities using α –& β–diversity. Feature subset selection – a sub-field of machine learning – can also provide a unique insight into the differences between metagenomic or 16S phenotypes. In particular, feature subset selection methods can obtain the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or functional features, that have a high-level of influence on the condition being studied. For example, in a previous study we have used information-theoretic feature selection to understand the differences between protein family abundances that best discriminate between age groups in the human gut microbiome. Results: We have developed a new Python command line tool, which is compatible with the widely adopted BIOM format, for microbial ecologists that implements information-theoretic subset selection methods for biological data formats. We demonstrate the software tools capabilities on publicly available datasets. Conclusions: We have made the software implementation of Fizzy available to the public under the GNU GPL license. The standalone implementation can be found at http://github.com/EESI/Fizzy.},

abstract = {Abstract Feature selection (FS) is a well-studied area that avoids issues related the curse of dimensionality and overfitting. FS is a preprocessing procedure that identifies the feature subset that is both relevant and non-redundant. Although FS has been driven by the exploration of “big data” and the development of high-performance computing, the implementation of scalable information-theoretic FS remains an under-explored topic. In this contribution, we revisit the greedy optimization procedure of information-theoretic filter FS and propose a semi-parallel optimizing paradigm that can provide an equivalent feature set as the greedy FS algorithms in a fraction of the time. We focus on greedy selection algorithms due to their larger computational complexity associated with a rapidly growing number of features. Our framework is benchmarked against twelve datasets, including one extremely large dataset that has more than a million features, and we show our framework can significantly speed up the process of FS while selecting nearly the same features as the state-of-the-art information-theoretic FS methods.},

abstract = {Background: Production of ornamental plants is a rapidlyexpandingtradeworldwide and has greateconomicpotential. Soil of the urban areas isoftenenrichedwithheavymetalscomingfromdifferentpotential sources and ornamental plants in these areas are usuallyexposed to suchmetal pollution. Amongheavymetals, lead has receivedconsiderable importance due to itsextremetoxicity and persistencebehavior. High level of lead (Pb) in environment leads to more accumulation of thistoxicmetal in plants. Materials and Methods: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lead on ornamental plant Petunia hybridaL. through pot experiment. In this research three different lead concentrations i.e. 10ppm, 20ppm and 30ppm were used to check the effect of lead on selected plant. These selected lead concentrations were given to plant in the form of lead nitrate [Pb (NO3)]. Lead effect was investigated on different growth attributes of Petunia hybrida L. Plant performance under lead stress was monitored through parameters such as chlorophyll and carotenoid content, ascorbic acid content, relative water content, above and below ground biomass, plant height, leaf area and number of leaves. Amount of lead taken up by above and below ground parts of the plant was also examined through atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results: Results showed that chlorophyll, carotenoids and biomass were significantly affected by all three lead treatments. However, applied lead concentrations had no effect on ascorbic acid, relative water content, plant height, leaf area and number of leaves of Petunia hybridaL. Plant did not exhibit any sign of visible injury due to lead stress. Lead concentration was highest in root as compared to above ground parts of the plant. Overall plant showed stable growth under all three lead treatments. Conclusion:This study indicated that Petunia hybrida L.can tolerate lead in soil up to the level of 30ppm.

abstract = {The advance of metagenomic studies provides the opportunity to identify microbial taxa that are associated with human diseases. Multiple methods exist for the association analysis. However, the results could be inconsistent, presenting challenges in interpreting the host-microbiome interactions. To address this issue, we develop Meta-Signer, a novel Meta genomic Sign ature Identifi er tool based on rank aggregation of features identified from multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks. Meta-Signer generates ranked taxa lists by training individual machine learning models over multiple training partitions and aggregates the ranked lists into a single list by an optimization procedure to represent the most informative and robust microbial features. A User will receive speedy assessment on the predictive performance of each ma-chine learning model using different numbers of the ranked features and determine the final models to be used for evaluation on external datasets. Meta-Signer is user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to explore their datasets quickly and efficiently.},
