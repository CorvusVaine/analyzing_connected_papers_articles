abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing methods provide considerable genomic information regarding human microbiomes, enabling us to discover and understand microbial diseases. Compositional differences have been reported between patients and healthy people, which could be used in the diagnosis of patients. Despite significant progress in this regard, the accuracy of these tools needs to be improved for applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. MDL4Microbiome, the method developed herein, demonstrated high accuracy in predicting disease status by using various features from metagenome sequences and a multimodal deep learning model. We propose combining three different features, i.e., conventional taxonomic profiles, genome-level relative abundance, and metabolic functional characteristics, to enhance classification accuracy. This deep learning model enabled the construction of a classifier that combines these various modalities encoded in the human microbiome. We achieved accuracies of 0.98, 0.76, 0.84, and 0.97 for predicting patients with inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and colorectal cancer, respectively; these are comparable or higher than classical machine learning methods. A deeper analysis was also performed on the resulting sets of selected features to understand the contribution of their different characteristics. MDL4Microbiome is a classifier with higher or comparable accuracy compared with other machine learning methods, which offers perspectives on feature generation with metagenome sequences in deep learning models and their advantages in the classification of host disease status.},

abstract = {Water reuse is increasingly pursued to alleviate global water scarcity. However, the wastewater treatment process does not achieve full removal of biological contaminants from wastewater, hence microorganisms and their genetic elements can be disseminated into the reclaimed water distribution systems (RWDS). In this study, reclaimed water samples are investigated via metagenomics to assess their bacterial diversity, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) at both point of entry (POE) and point of use (POU) in 3 RWDS. The number of shared bacterial orders identified by metagenome was higher at the POE than POU among the three sites, indicating that specific conditions in RWDS can cause further differentiation in the microbial communities at the end of the distribution system. Two bacterial orders, namely Rhizobiales and Sphingomonadales, had high replication rates in two of the examined RWDS (i.e., site A and B), and were present in higher relative abundance in POU than at POE. In addition, MAG and ARG relative abundance exhibited a strong correlation (R2 = 0.58) in POU, indicating that bacteria present in POU may have a high incidence of ARG. Specifically, resistance genes associated with efflux pump mechanisms (e.g., adeF and qacH) increased in its relative abundance from POU to POE at two of the RWDS (i.e., site A and B). When correlated with the water quality data that suggests a significantly lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration at site D than the other two RWDS, the metagenomic data suggest that low DOC is needed to maintain the biological stability of reclaimed water along the distribution network.},

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities influence their environment by modifying the availability of compounds such as nutrients or chemical elicitors. Knowing the microbial composition of a site is therefore relevant to improving productivity or health. However, sequencing facilities are not always available, or may be prohibitively expensive in some cases. Thus, it would be desirable to computationally predict the microbial composition from more accessible, easily-measured features. Results Integrating Deep Learning techniques with microbiome data, we propose an artificial neural network architecture based on heterogeneous autoencoders to condense the long vector of microbial abundance values into a deep latent space representation. Then, we design a model to predict the deep latent space and, consequently, to predict the complete microbial composition using environmental features as input. The performance of our system is examined using the rhizosphere microbiome of Maize. We reconstruct the microbial composition (717 taxa) from the deep latent space (10 values) with high fidelity (¿0.9 Pearson correlation). We then successfully predict microbial composition from environmental variables such as plant age, temperature or precipitation (0.73 Pearson correlation, 0.42 Bray-Curtis). We extend this to predict microbiome composition under hypothetical scenarios, such as future climate change conditions. Finally, via transfer learning, we predict microbial composition in a distinct scenario with only a hundred sequences, and distinct environmental features. We propose that our deep latent space may assist microbiome-engineering strategies when technical or financial resources are limited, through predicting current or future microbiome compositions.

abstract = {Background Gut microbiome has been associated with the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with various types of cancers but not yet in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aims To investigate the association between gut microbiome and efficacy of ICI in patients with HCC. Methods Patients with HCC who were scheduled to receive ICI were prospectively enrolled. Fecal samples were collected within 7 days before initiation of ICI (baseline) and 8 weeks later. Gut microbiome was assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun whole-genome sequencing and correlated with objective response (complete or partial response), disease control (objective response or stable disease for ≥16 weeks), and overall survival. Results Thirty-six patients with HCC were enrolled, and 20 of them provided both baseline and 8-week feces. Alpha diversity, richness, and compositions of baseline gut microbiome indicated no difference between responders and nonresponders or between disease control and nondisease control groups. For the 20 paired feces, immunotherapy did not change any of the major microbiome features. No specific taxa were enriched in patients with objective response. Three taxa—Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, and Acidaminococcus—were enriched in patients with disease control. However, the baseline abundance of these three taxa did not predict overall survival benefit. Conclusions In this exploratory study, we failed to disclose any overt association of gut microbiome with the efficacy of ICI in patients with HCC. A larger prospective study is warranted for definite conclusion.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
The field of metagenomics has provided valuable insights into the structure, diversity and ecology within microbial communities. One key step in metagenomics analysis is to assemble reads into longer contigs which are then binned into groups of contigs that belong to different species present in the metagenomic sample. Binning of contigs plays an important role in metagenomics and most available binning algorithms bin contigs using genomic features such as oligonucleotide/k-mer composition and contig coverage. As metagenomic contigs are derived from the assembly process, they are output from the underlying assembly graph which contains valuable connectivity information between contigs that can be used for binning.


RESULTS
We propose GraphBin, a new binning method that makes use of the assembly graph and applies a label propagation algorithm to refine the binning result of existing tools.We show that GraphBin can make use of the assembly graphs constructed from both the de Bruijn graph and the overlap-layout-consensus approach. Moreover, we demonstrate improved experimental results from GraphBin in terms of identifying mis-binned contigs and binning of contigs discarded by existing binning tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the information from the assembly graph has been used in a tool for the binning of metagenomic contigs.

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.},

abstract = {The human microbiome plays a number of critical roles, impacting almost every aspect of human health and well-being. Conditions in the microbiome have been linked to a number of significant diseases. Additionally, revolutions in sequencing technology have led to a rapid increase in publicly-available sequencing data. Consequently, there have been growing efforts to predict disease status from metagenomic sequencing data, with a proliferation of new approaches in the last few years. Some of these efforts have explored utilizing a powerful form of machine learning called deep learning, which has been applied successfully in several biological domains. Here, we review some of these methods and the algorithms that they are based on, with a particular focus on deep learning methods. We also perform a deeper analysis of Type 2 Diabetes and obesity datasets that have eluded improved results, using a variety of machine learning and feature extraction methods.

abstract = {Microbiome composition profiles generated from 16S rRNA sequencing have been extensively studied for their usefulness in phenotype trait prediction, including for complex diseases such as diabetes and obesity. These microbiome compositions have typically been quantified in the form of Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) count matrices.

The overall effect of these different types of predictors when used in concert with various machine learning methods has been difficult to assess, due to varied combinations described in the literature. Here we provide an in-depth investigation of more than 1,000 combinations of these three clustering/counting methods, in combination with varied choices for normalization and filtering, grouping at various taxonomic levels, and the use of more than ten commonly used machine learning methods for phenotype prediction. The use of short k-mers, which have computational advantages and conceptual simplicity, is shown to be effective as a source for microbiome-based prediction. Among machine-learning approaches, tree-based methods show consistent, though modest, advantages in prediction accuracy. We describe the various advantages and disadvantages of combinations in analysis approaches, and provide general observations to serve as a useful guide for future trait-prediction explorations using microbiome data.},

This workflow scales to run on thousands of metagenome samples per year, which can vary by the complexity of microbial communities and sequencing depth. Here, we describe the different tools, databases, and parameters used at different steps of the workflow to help with the interpretation of metagenome data available in IMG and to enable researchers to apply this workflow to their own data. We use 20 publicly available sediment metagenomes to illustrate the computing requirements for the different steps and highlight the typical results of data processing. The workflow modules for read filtering and metagenome assembly are available as a workflow description language (WDL) file (https://code.jgi.doe.gov/BFoster/jgi_meta_wdl). The workflow modules for annotation and binning are provided as a service to the user community at https://img.jgi.doe.gov/submit and require filling out the project and associated metadata descriptions in the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) (S. Mukherjee, D. Stamatis, J. Bertsch, G. Ovchinnikova, et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 49:D723–D733, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa983). IMPORTANCE The DOE JGI Metagenome Workflow is designed for processing metagenomic data sets starting from Illumina fastq files. It performs data preprocessing, error correction, assembly, structural and functional annotation, and binning. The results of processing are provided in several standard formats, such as fasta and gff, and can be used for subsequent integration into the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) system where they can be compared to a comprehensive set of publicly available metagenomes. As of 30 July 2020, 7,155 JGI metagenomes have been processed by the DOE JGI Metagenome Workflow. Here, we present a metagenome workflow developed at the JGI that generates rich data in standard formats and has been optimized for downstream analyses ranging from assessment of the functional and taxonomic composition of microbial communities to genome-resolved metagenomics and the identification and characterization of novel taxa. This workflow is currently being used to analyze thousands of metagenomic data sets in a consistent and standardized manner.},

abstract = {The rise of metagenomics offers a leap forward for understanding the genetic diversity of microorganisms in many different complex environments by providing a platform that can identify potentially unlimited numbers of known and novel microorganisms. As such, it is impossible to imagine new major initiatives without metagenomics. Nevertheless, it represents a relatively new discipline with various levels of complexity and demands on bioinformatics. The underlying principles and methods used in metagenomics are often seen as common knowledge and often not detailed or fragmented. Therefore, we reviewed these to guide microbiologists in taking the first steps into metagenomics. We specifically focus on a workflow aimed at reconstructing individual genomes, that is, metagenome‐assembled genomes, integrating DNA sequencing, assembly, binning, identification and annotation.},

abstract = {Microorganisms play a vital role in living systems in numerous ways. In the soil or ocean environment, microbes are involved in diverse processes, such as carbon and nitrogen cycle, nutrient recycling, and energy acquisition. The relation between microbial dysbiosis and disease developments has been extensively studied. In particular, microbial communities in the human gut are associated with the pathophysiology of several chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. Therefore, analyzing the distribution of microorganisms and their associations with the environment is a key step in understanding nature. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, a vast amount of metagenomic data on unculturable microbes in addition to culturable microbes has been produced. To reconstruct microbial genomes, several assembly algorithms have been developed by incorporating metagenomic features, such as uneven depth. Since it is difficult to reconstruct complete microbial genomes from metagenomic reads, contig binning approaches were suggested to collect contigs that originate from the same genome. To estimate the microbial composition in the environment, various methods have been developed to classify individual reads or contigs and profile bacterial proportions. Since microbial communities affect their hosts and environments through metabolites, metabolic profiles from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data have been estimated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of computational methods that can be applied to investigate microbiomes using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data. The limitations of metagenomic studies and the key approaches to overcome such problems are discussed.},

abstract = {Microorganisms are everywhere. Recent studies showed that the mixture of microbes or the microbiome on the human body plays important roles in human physiology and diseases. Metagenomic sequencing is a key technology for studying microbiomes. It produces massive amounts of data in the form of short sequencing reads. A single metagenomic sample can contain 10 7 to 10 8 reads of about 100-nucleotide (nt) length each in a typical shotgun metagenomic sequencing study. They contain rich information about microbiomes and their functions, but reading out those information from the huge highly fragmented data has multiple challenges for mathematical models, bioinformatics methods, and computer algorithms. In this paper, we review the basic bioinformatics tasks and existing methods in processing and analyzing metagenomic data, and discuss remaining open challenges and practical observations. The aim of the paper is to provide readers a whole picture of metagenomic data processing and analysis, and a reference and perspective to start with for computational scientists who are interested in this exciting field.},

abstract = {Metagenomics is emerging as an important tool in biosurveillance, public health, and clinical applications. However, ease-of-use for execution and data analysis remains a barrier-of-entry to the adoption of metagenomics in applied health and forensics settings. In addition, these venues often have more stringent requirements for reporting, accuracy, and precision than the traditional ecological research role of the technology. Here, we present PanGIA (Pan-Genomics for Infectious Agents), a novel bioinformatics analysis platform for hosting, processing, analyzing, and reporting shotgun metagenomics data of complex samples suspected of containing one or more pathogens. PanGIA was developed to address gaps that often preclude clinicians, medical technicians, forensics personnel, or other non-expert end-users from the routine application of metagenomics for pathogen identification. Though primarily designed to detect pathogenic microorganisms within clinical and environmental metagenomics data, PanGIA also serves as an analytical framework for microbial community profiling and comparative metagenomics. To provide statistical confidence in PanGIA’s taxonomic assignments, the system provides two independent estimations of probability for species and strain level detection. First, PanGIA integrates coverage data with ‘uniqueness’ information mapped across each reference genome for a stand-alone determination of confidence for each query sequence at each taxonomy level. Second, if a negative-control sample is provided, PanGIA compares this sample with a corresponding experimental unknown sample and determines a measure of confidence associated with ‘detection above background’. An integrated graphical user interface allows interactive interrogation and enables users to summarize multiple sample results by confidence score, normalized read abundance, reference genome linear coverage, depth-of-coverage, RPKM, and other metrics to detect specific organisms-of-interest. Comparison testing of the PanGIA algorithm against a number of recent k-mer, read-mapping, and marker-gene based taxonomy classifiers across various real-world datasets with spiked targets shows superior mean positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity. PanGIA can process a five million paired-end read dataset in under 1 hour on commodity computational hardware. The source code and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/LANL-Bioinformatics/PanGIA or https://github.com/mriglobal/PanGIA. The database for PanGIA can be downloaded from ftp://bioinformatics.mriglobal.org/.

abstract = {Objective Fusobacteria are not common nor relatively abundant in non-colorectal cancer (CRC) populations, however, we identified multiple Fusobacterium taxa nearly absent in western and rural populations to be comparatively more prevalent and relatively abundant in southern Chinese populations. We investigated whether these represented known or novel lineages in the Fusobacterium genus, and assessed their genomes for features implicated in development of cancer. Methods Prevalence and relative abundances of fusobacterial species were calculated from 3157 CRC and non-CRC gut metagenomes representing 16 populations from various biogeographies. Microbial genomes were assembled and compared with existing reference genomes to assess novel fusobacterial diversity. Phylogenetic distribution of virulence genes implicated in CRC was investigated. Results Irrespective of CRC disease status, southern Chinese populations harboured increased prevalence (maximum 39% vs 7%) and relative abundances (average 0.4% vs 0.04% of gut community) of multiple recognised and novel fusobacterial taxa phylogenetically distinct from Fusobacterium nucleatum. Genomes assembled from southern Chinese gut metagenomes increased existing fusobacterial diversity by 14.3%. Homologues of the FadA adhesin linked to CRC were consistently detected in several monophyletic lineages sister to and inclusive of F. varium and F. ulcerans, but not F. mortiferum. We also detected increased prevalence and relative abundances of F. varium in CRC compared with non-CRC cohorts, which together with distribution of FadA homologues supports a possible association with gut disease. Conclusion The proportion of fusobacteria in guts of southern Chinese populations are higher compared with several western and rural populations in line with the notion of environment/biogeography driving human gut microbiome composition. Several non-nucleatum taxa possess FadA homologues and were enriched in CRC cohorts; whether this imposes a risk in developing CRC and other gut diseases deserves further investigation.},

Such steps include quality control, adapter trimming, host decontamination, metagenomic classification, read assembly, and alignment to reference genomes. Results: We present here an extensible and modular pipeline called Sunbeam that performs these steps in a consistent and reproducible way. It features a one-step installation and novel tools for eliminating artifactual sequences that may interfere with downstream analysis including Komplexity, a novel software tool to eliminate potentially problematic, low-complexity nucleotide sequences from metagenomic data. Another unique component of the Sunbeam pipeline is an easy-to-use extension framework that enables users to add custom processing or analysis steps directly to the Sunbeam workflow. Conclusions: Sunbeam provides a foundation to build more in-depth analyses and to enable comparisons between disparate sequencing experiments by standardizing routine pre-processing and analytical steps.

abstract = {There is little consensus in the literature as to which approach for classification of Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequences is best. In this paper, we examine two of the most popular algorithms, Kraken2 and Metaphlan2 utilizing four publicly available datasets. As expected from previous literature, we found that Kraken2 reports more overall taxa while Metaphlan2 reports fewer taxa while classifying fewer overall reads. To our surprise, however, Kraken 2 reported not only more taxa but many more taxa that were significantly associated with metadata. This implies that either Kraken2 is more sensitive to taxa that are biologically relevant and are simply missed by Metaphlan2, or that Kraken2’s classification errors are generated in such a way to impact inference. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we compared Spearman correlations coefficients of each taxa against each taxa with higher abundance from the same dataset. We found that Kraken2, but not Metaphlan2, showed a consistent pattern of classifying low abundance taxa that generated high correlation coefficients with higher abundance taxa. Neither Metaphlan2, nor 16S sequences that were available for two of our four datasets, showed this pattern. Simple simulations based on a variable Poisson error rate sampled from the uniform distribution with an average error rate of 0.0005 showed strikingly strong concordance with the observed correlation patterns from Kraken2. Our results suggest that Kraken2 consistently misclassifies high abundance taxa into the same erroneous low abundance taxa creating “phantom” taxa have a similar pattern of inference as the high abundance source. Because of the large sequencing depths of modern WGS cohorts, these “phantom” taxa will appear statistically significant in statistical models even with a low overall rate of classification error from Kraken. Our simulations suggest that this can occur with average error rates as low as 1 in 2,000 reads. These data suggest a novel metric for evaluating classifier accuracy and suggest that the pattern of classification errors should be considered in addition to overall classification error rate since consistent classification errors have a more profound impact on inference compared to classification errors that do not always result in assignment to the same erroneous taxa. This work highlights fundamental questions on how classifiers function and interact with large sequencing depth and statistical models that still need to be resolved for WGS, especially if correlation coefficients between taxa are to be used to build covariance networks. Our work also suggests that despite its limitations, 16S rRNA sequencing may still be useful as neither of the two most popular 16S classifiers showed these patterns of inflated correlation coefficients between taxa.},

abstract = {Metagenomics analysis revealing the composition and functional repertoire of complex microbial communities typically relies on large amounts of sequence data. Numerous analysis strategies and computational tools are available for their analysis. Fully integrated automated analysis pipelines such as MG-RAST or MEGAN6 are user-friendly but not designed for integrating specific knowledge on the biological system under study. In order to facilitate the consideration of such knowledge, we introduce a modular, adaptable analysis pipeline combining existing tools. We applied the novel pipeline to simulated mock data sets focusing on anaerobic digestion microbiomes and compare results to those obtained with established automated analysis pipelines. We find that the analysis strategy and choice of tools and parameters have a strong effect on the inferred taxonomic community composition, but not on the inferred functional profile. By including prior knowledge, computational costs can be decreased while improving result accuracy. While automated off-the-shelf analysis pipelines are easy to apply and require no knowledge on the microbial system under study, custom-made pipelines require more preparation time and bioinformatics expertise. This extra effort is minimized by our modular, flexible, custom-made pipeline, which can be adapted to different scenarios and can take available knowledge on the microbial system under study into account.},

abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for contig binning only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species). In this paper, we introduce GraphBin2 which refines the binning results obtained from existing tools and, more importantly, is able to assign contigs to multiple bins. GraphBin2 uses the connectivity and coverage information from assembly graphs to adjust existing binning results on contigs and to infer contigs shared by multiple species. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that GraphBin2 not only improves binning results of existing tools but also supports to assign contigs to multiple bins. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Applied computing → Bioinformatics; Applied computing → Computational genomics},

We trained several component classifiers and a robust ensemble classifier with data generated from taxonomy-dependent and taxonomy-free approaches. Also, we implemented class weighting and an optimal oversampling technique to overcome the class imbalance in the primary data. In each instance, we observed that the component classifiers performed differently, whereas the ensemble classifier consistently yielded optimal performance. Finally, we predicted the source cities of mystery samples provided by the organizers. Our results highlight the unreliability of restricting the classification of metagenomic samples to source origins to a single classification algorithm.

Various methods for classifying metagenomic data and estimating taxonomic profiles, broadly referred to as metagenomic profilers, have been developed. Yet, benchmarking metagenomic profilers remains challenging because some tools are designed to report relative sequence abundance while others report relative taxonomic abundance. Here, we show how misleading conclusions can be drawn by neglecting this distinction between relative abundance types when benchmarking metagenomic profilers. Moreover, we show compelling evidence that interchanging sequence abundance and taxonomic abundance will influence both per-sample summary statistics and cross-sample comparisons. We suggest that the microbiome research community should pay attention to potentially misleading biological conclusions arising from this issue when benchmarking metagenomic profilers, by carefully considering the type of abundance data that was analyzed and interpreted, and clearly stating the strategy used for metagenomic profiling.},

abstract = {Human tissue is increasingly being whole genome sequenced as we transition into an era of genomic medicine. With this arises the potential to detect sequences originating from microorganisms, including pathogens amid the plethora of human sequencing reads. In cancer research, the tumorigenic ability of pathogens is being recognized, for example, Helicobacter pylori and human papillomavirus in the cases of gastric non-cardia and cervical carcinomas, respectively. As of yet, no benchmark has been carried out on the performance of computational approaches for bacterial and viral detection within host-dominated sequence data. We present the results of benchmarking over 70 distinct combinations of tools and parameters on 100 simulated cancer datasets spiked with realistic proportions of bacteria. mOTUs2 and Kraken are the highest performing individual tools achieving median genus-level F1 scores of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. mOTUs2 demonstrates a high performance in estimating bacterial proportions. Employing Kraken on unassembled sequencing reads produces a good but variable performance depending on post-classification filtering parameters. These approaches are investigated on a selection of cervical and gastric cancer whole genome sequences where Alphapapillomavirus and Helicobacter are detected in addition to a variety of other interesting genera. We provide the top-performing pipelines from this benchmark in a unifying tool called SEPATH, which is amenable to high throughput sequencing studies across a range of high-performance computing clusters.

Here we propose MetaCoAG, a tool that utilizes assembly graphs with the composition and coverage information to bin metagenomic contigs. MetaCoAG uses single-copy marker genes to estimate the number of initial bins, assigns contigs into bins iteratively and adjusts the number of bins dynamically throughout the binning process. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that MetaCoAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art binning tools, producing more high-quality bins than the second-best tool, with an average median F1-score of 88.40%. To the best of our knowledge, MetaCoAG is the first stand-alone binning tool to make direct use of the assembly graph information. MetaCoAG is available at https://github.com/Vini2/MetaCoAG.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Metagenomics studies microbial genomes in an ecosystem such as the gastrointestinal tract of a human. Identification of novel microbial species and quantification of their distributional variations among different samples that are sequenced using next-generation-sequencing technology hold the key to the success of most metagenomic studies. To achieve these goals, we propose a simple yet powerful metagenomic binning method, MetaBMF. The method does not require prior knowledge of reference genomes and produces highly accurate results, even at a strain level. Thus, it can be broadly used to identify disease-related microbial organisms that are not well-studied.


RESULTS
Mathematically, we count the number of mapped reads on each assembled genomic fragment cross different samples as our input matrix and propose a scalable stratified angle regression algorithm to factorize this count matrix into a product of a binary matrix and a nonnegative matrix. The binary matrix can be used to separate microbial species and the nonnegative matrix quantifies the species distributions in different samples. In simulation and empirical studies, we demonstrate that MetaBMF has high binning accuracy. It can not only bin DNA fragments accurately at a species level but also at a strain level. As shown in our example, we can accurately identify the Shiga-toxigenic E. coli O104:H4 strain which led to the 2011 German E.coli outbreak. Our efforts in these areas should lead to (1) fundamental advances in metagenomic binning (2) development and refinement of technology for the rapid identification and quantification of microbial distributions (3) finding of potential probiotics or reliable pathogenic bacterial strains.

abstract = {Metagenomes can be analysed using different approaches and tools. One of the most important distinctions is the way to perform taxonomic and functional assignment, choosing between the usage of assemblies or the direct analysis of raw sequence reads instead. Many instances of each approach can be found in the literature, but to the best of our knowledge no evaluation of their different performances has been carried on, and we question if their results are comparable. We have studied this point by analysing several real and mock metagenomes using different methodologies and tools, and comparing the resulting taxonomic and functional profiles. Our results show that database completeness is the main factor determining the performance of the methods relying on direct read assignment either by homology, k-mer composition or similarity to marker genes, while methods relying on assembly and assignment of predicted genes are most influenced by sequencing depth, that in turn determines the completeness of the assembly. Although differences exist, taxonomic profiles are rather similar between raw read assignment and assembly assignment methods, while they are more divergent for methods based on k-mers and marker genes. Regarding functional annotation, analysis of raw reads retrieves more functions, but it also makes a significant number of over-predictions. Assembly methods are more advantageous as the size of the metagenome grows bigger.},

abstract = {Background Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study the structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for binning contigs only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species). Results In this paper, we introduce GraphBin2 which refines the binning results obtained from existing tools and, more importantly, is able to assign contigs to multiple bins. GraphBin2 uses the connectivity and coverage information from assembly graphs to adjust existing binning results on contigs and to infer contigs shared by multiple species. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that GraphBin2 not only improves binning results of existing tools but also supports to assign contigs to multiple bins. Conclusion GraphBin2 incorporates the coverage information into the assembly graph to refine the binning results obtained from existing binning tools. GraphBin2 also enables the detection of contigs that may belong to multiple species. We show that GraphBin2 outperforms its predecessor GraphBin on both simulated and real datasets.
