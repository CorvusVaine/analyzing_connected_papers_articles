abstract = {Correct identification of different human epithelial materials such as from skin, saliva and vaginal origin is relevant in forensic casework as it provides crucial information for crime reconstruction. However, the overlap in human cell type composition between these three epithelial materials provides challenges for their differentiation and identification when using previously proposed human cell biomarkers, while their microbiota composition largely differs. By using validated 16S rRNA gene massively parallel sequencing data from the Human Microbiome Project of 1636 skin, oral and vaginal samples, 50 taxonomy-independent deep learning networks were trained to classify these three tissues. Validation testing was performed in de-novo generated high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using the Ion Torrent™ Personal Genome Machine from 110 test samples: 56 hand skin, 31 saliva and 23 vaginal secretion specimens. Body-site classification accuracy of these test samples was very high as indicated by AUC values of 0.99 for skin, 0.99 for oral, and 1 for vaginal secretion. Misclassifications were limited to 3 (5%) skin samples. Additional forensic validation testing was performed in mock casework samples by de-novo high-throughput sequencing of 19 freshly-prepared samples and 22 samples aged for 1 up to 7.6 years. All of the 19 fresh and 20 (91%) of the 22 aged mock casework samples were correctly tissue-type classified. Moreover, comparing the microbiome results with outcomes from previous human mRNA-based tissue identification testing in the same 16 aged mock casework samples reveals that our microbiome approach performs better in 12 (75%), similarly in 2 (12.5%), and less good in 2 (12.5%) of the samples. Our results demonstrate that this new microbiome approach allows for accurate tissue-type classification of three human epithelial materials of skin, oral and vaginal origin, which is highly relevant for future forensic investigations.},

abstract = {Analysis of biological evidence typically begins with a preliminary screening for the presence of biological fluids, traditionally with enzymatic or immunologic tests and of late by RNA profiling. The goal of this study was to create a whole transcriptome protocol, to view potential degradation effects in forensically relevant body fluids. Total RNA from fresh and aged blood, menstrual blood, saliva, semen, skin and vaginal secretion was analyzed with a massively parallel sequencing method. Two RNA-Seq library protocols with and without rRNA depletion were tested and compared. The rRNA depletion step had a negative influence on the sequencing quality and on the downstream analyses. From the human and bacterial RNA sequences, source-specific signatures could be identified. Aged samples showed in general a higher level of RNA degradation and decreased bacterial diversity. In summary, we could show that transcriptional profiling and metagenome analysis are powerful tools to provide additional information about the trace evidence.},

abstract = {The human skin microbiome is comprised of diverse communities of bacterial, eukaryotic, and viral taxa and contributes millions of additional genes to the repertoire of human genes, affecting human metabolism and immune response. Numerous genetic and environmental factors influence the microbiome composition and as such contribute to individual-specific microbial signatures which may be exploited for forensic applications. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential to associate skin microbial profiles collected from touched items to their individual owner, mainly using unsupervised methods from samples collected over short time intervals. Those studies utilize either targeted 16S rRNA or shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize skin microbiomes; however, these approaches have limited species and strain resolution and susceptibility to stochastic effects, respectively. Clade-specific markers from the skin microbiome, using supervised learning, can predict individual identity using skin microbiomes from their respective donors with high accuracy. In this study the hidSkinPlex is presented, a novel targeted sequencing method using skin microbiome markers developed for human identification. The hidSkinPlex (comprised of 286 bacterial (and phage) family-, genus-, species-, and subspecies-level markers), initially was evaluated on three bacterial control samples represented in the panel (i.e., Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, and Rothia dentocariosa) to assess the performance of the multiplex. The hidSkinPlex was further evaluated for prediction purposes. The hidSkinPlex markers were used to attribute skin microbiomes collected from eight individuals from three body sites (i.e., foot (Fb), hand (Hp) and manubrium (Mb)) to their host donor. Supervised learning, specifically regularized multinomial logistic regression and 1-nearest-neighbor classification were used to classify skin microbiomes to their hosts with up to 92% (Fb), 96% (Mb), and 100% (Hp) accuracy. All samples (n=72) regardless of body site origin were correctly classified with up to 94% accuracy, and body site origin could be predicted with up to 86% accuracy. Finally, human short tandem repeat and single-nucleotide polymorphism profiles were generated from skin swab extracts from a single subject to highlight the potential to use microbiome profiling in conjunction with low-biomass samples. The hidSkinPlex is a novel targeted enrichment approach to profile skin microbiomes for human forensic identification purposes and provides a method to further characterize the utility of skin microflora for human identification in future studies, such as the stability and diversity of the personal skin microbiome.},

abstract = {Vaginal fluid and saliva are of great importance in forensic sciences. The identification of vaginal fluid or saliva is especially important in criminal cases. Microbes are considered as a promising marker for the identification of body fluids. In this study, 18 salivary fluids and 18 vaginal fluid samples were collected from 18 healthy women of the Han population in Guangdong province, China. The microbes of the above samples were analyzed by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the microbes whose proportions are over 1% in saliva samples distributed across 12 genera and 57 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and in vaginal fluid distributed across 4 genera and 9 OTUs. The microbes that dominated in saliva were quite different from those dominated in vaginal fluids. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm was used to screen out the specific microbes of the studied samples, and the results showed that the specific microbes in saliva samples are Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Veillonella parvula, and Aggregatibacter segnis, while in vaginal fluid is Lactobacillus iners.},

abstract = {In forensic investigations involving human biological traces, cell type identification is often required. Identifying the cell type from which a human STR profile has originated can assist in verifying scenarios. Several techniques have been developed for this purpose, most of which focus on molecular characteristics of human cells. Here we present a microarray method focusing on the microbial populations that are associated with human cell material. A microarray with 863 probes targeting (sets of) species, specific genera, groups of genera or families was designed for this study and evaluated with samples from different body sites: hand, foot, groin, penis, vagina, mouth and faeces. In total 175 samples from healthy individuals were analysed. Next to human faeces, 15 feline and 15 canine faeces samples were also included. Both clustering and classification analysis were used for data analysis. Faecal and oral samples could clearly be distinguished from vaginal and skin samples, and also canine and feline faeces could be differentiated from human faeces. Some penis samples showed high similarity to vaginal samples, others to skin samples. Discriminating between skin samples from different skin sites proved to be challenging. As a proof of principle, twenty-one mock case samples were analysed with the microarray method. All mock case samples were clustered or classified within the correct main cluster/group. Only two of the mock case samples were assigned to the wrong sub-cluster/class; with classification one additional sample was classified within the wrong sub-class. Overall, the microarray method is a valuable addition to already existing cell typing techniques. Combining the results of microbial population analysis with for instance mRNA typing can increase the evidential value of a trace, since both techniques focus on independent targets within a sample.},

This assay, together with an additional in-house designed assay for the Ion Torrent PGM/S5 platform, was the basis for a collaborative exercise within 17 EUROFORGEN and EDNAP laboratories, in order to test the efficacy of targeted mRNA sequencing to identify body fluids. The task was to analyse the supplied dried body fluid stains and, optionally, participants' own bona fide or mock casework samples of human origin, according to specified protocols. The provided primer pools for the Illumina MiSeq/FGx and the Ion Torrent PGM/S5 platforms included 33 and 29 body fluid specific targets, respectively, to identify blood, saliva, semen, vaginal secretion, menstrual blood and skin. The results demonstrated moderate to high count values in the body fluid or tissue of interest with little to no counts in non-target body fluids. There was some inter-laboratory variability in read counts, but overall the results of the laboratories were comparable in that highly expressed markers showed high read counts and less expressed markers showed lower counts. We performed a partial least squares (PLS) analysis on the data, where blood, menstrual blood, saliva and semen markers and samples clustered well. The results of this collaborative mRNA massively parallel sequencing (MPS) exercise support targeted mRNA sequencing as a reliable body fluid identification method that could be added to the repertoire of forensic MPS panels.},

abstract = {Molecular methods for body fluid identification have been extensively researched in the forensic community over the last decade, mostly focusing on RNA‐based methods. Microbial DNA analysis has long been used for forensic applications, such as postmortem interval estimations, but only recently has it been applied to body fluid identification. High‐throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene by previous research groups revealed that microbial signatures and abundances vary across human body fluids at the genus and/or species taxonomic level. Since quantitative PCR is still the current technique used in forensic DNA analysis, the purpose of this study was to design a qPCR multiplex targeting the 16S gene of Bacteroides uniformis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Lactobacillus crispatus that can distinguish between feces, saliva, and vaginal/menstrual secretions, respectively. Primers and probes were designed at the species level because these bacteria are highly abundant within their respective fluid. The validated 16S triplex was evaluated in DNA extracts from thirty donors of each body fluid. A classification regression tree model resulted in 96.5% classification accuracy of the population data, which demonstrates the ability of this 16S triplex to presumptively identify these fluids with high confidence at the quantification step of the forensic workflow using minimal input volume of DNA extracted from evidentiary samples.},

abstract = {In forensics the DNA-profile is used to identify the person who left a biological trace, but information on body fluid can also be essential in the evidence evaluation process. Microbial composition data could potentially be used for body fluid recognition as an improved alternative to the currently used presumptive tests. We have developed a customized workflow for interpretation of bacterial 16S sequence data based on a model composed of Partial Least Squares (PLS) in combination with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Large data sets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the American Gut Project (AGP) were used to test different settings in order to optimize performance. From the initial cross-validation of body fluid recognition within the HMP data, the optimal overall accuracy was close to 98%. Sensitivity values for the fecal and oral samples were ≥0.99, followed by the vaginal samples with 0.98 and the skin and nasal samples with 0.96 and 0.81 respectively. Specificity values were high for all 5 categories, mostly >0.99. This optimal performance was achieved by using the following settings: Taxonomic profiles based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 0.98 identity (OTU98), Aitchisons simplex transform with C = 1 pseudo-count and no regularization (r = 1) in the PLS step. Variable selection did not improve the performance further. To test for robustness across sequencing platforms, we also trained the classifier on HMP data and tested on the AGP data set. In this case, the standard OTU based approach showed moderately decline in accuracy. However, by using taxonomic profiles made by direct assignment of reads to a genus, we were able to nearly maintain the high accuracy levels. The optimal combination of settings was still used, except the taxonomic level being genus instead of OTU98. The performance may be improved even further by using higher resolution taxonomic bins.},

abstract = {The identification of biological traces provides vital evidence in forensic reconstruction at crime scenes, especially in sexual offences. Compared with traditional presumptive or confirmatory methods, the microbiome-based method has been proven to be of great value in body fluid identification. Mixture of body fluids or tissue is common in sexual assault cases; thus, it is essential to determine the sources of mixed samples. In this study, 60 samples consisting of skin, saliva, and a mixed model of saliva deposited on facial skin were collected from a population living in Guangdong. Through 16s rDNA high-throughput sequencing, we identified the predominant microbes in saliva samples, viz., Haemophilus parainfluenzae T3T1 , Neisseria flava , Gemella haemolysans , Prevotella melaninogenica , and Actinomyces odontolyticus ; in skin samples, Cutibacterium acnes and Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum were the predominant species. The microbial composition of the same body fluid or tissue is similar in different individuals. However, among different body fluids or tissue, the composition of microflora in saliva is more stable than that on skin. Additionally, the microbial community in the mixed model of saliva deposited on facial skin from the same and different individuals was clearly determined by the constituent fluids or tissue, apart from the differences among the donors. Overall, the microbiome-based method may have good potential as a tool for identifying single and mixed body fluid or tissue.},

The task was to identify dried menstrual blood and vaginal secretion stains using specific RNA biomarkers, and additionally test 3 housekeeping genes for their suitability as reference genes. Six menstrual blood and six vaginal secretion stains, two dilution series (1/4-1/64 pieces of a menstrual blood/vaginal swab) and, optionally, bona fide or mock casework samples of human or non-human origin were analyzed by 24 participating laboratories, using RNA extraction or RNA/DNA co-extraction methods. Two novel menstrual blood mRNA multiplexes were used: MMP triplex (MMP7, MMP10, MMP11) and MB triplex (MSX1, LEFTY2, SFRP4) in conjunction with a housekeeping gene triplex (B2M, UBC, UCE). Two novel mRNA multiplexes and a HBD1 singleplex were used for the identification of vaginal secretion: Vag triplex (MYOZ1, CYP2B7P1 and MUC4) and a Lactobacillus-specific Lacto triplex (Ljen, Lcris, Lgas). The laboratories used different chemistries and instrumentation and all were able to successfully isolate and detect mRNA in dried stains. The simultaneous extraction of RNA and DNA allowed for positive identification of the tissue/fluid source of origin by mRNA profiling as well as a simultaneous identification of the body fluid donor by STR profiling, also from old and compromised casework samples. The results of this and the previous collaborative RNA exercises support RNA profiling as a reliable body fluid identification method that can easily be combined with current STR typing technology.},

In this study, we performed PCR-based detection of microbial signatures of vaginal fluid, saliva, and feces in a Han Chinese population. We investigated the 16S rRNA genes of Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Atopobium vaginae in vaginal fluid, the 16S rRNA and the glucosyltransferase enzyme genes of Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans in saliva, and the 16S rRNA genes of Enterococcus species, the RNA polymerase β-subunit gene of Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the α-1-6 mannanase gene of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in feces. As a result, the detection proportions of L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, L. iners, and A. vaginae were 15/16, 5/16, 8/16, 14/16, and 3/16 in 16 vaginal fluid donors, respectively. L. crispatus and L. jensenii were specifically detected in vaginal fluid; L. gasseri, L. iners, and A. vaginae were also detected in non-vaginal fluid. S. salivarius and S. mutans were not specifically detected in saliva. The detection proportions of Enterococcus species, B. uniformis, B. vulgatus, and B. thetaiotaomicron in 16 feces samples were 16/16, 12/16, 15/16, and 11/16, respectively. B. uniformis and B. thetaiotaomicron were specifically detected in feces. In addition, DNA samples prepared for the identification of body fluid can also be used for individual identification by short tandem repeat typing. The mean detection sensitivities of L. crispatus and L. jensenii were 0.362 and 0.249 pg/uL, respectively. In conclusion, L. crispatus, L. jensenii, B. uniformis, and B. thetaiotaomicron can be used as effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid and feces.},

abstract = {The European Forensic Genetics Network of Excellence (EUROFORGEN-NoE) undertook a collaborative project on mRNA-based body fluid/skin typing and the interpretation of the resulting RNA and DNA data. Although both body fluids and skin are composed of a variety of cell types with different functions and gene expression profiles, we refer to the procedure as 'cell type inference'. Nine laboratories participated in the project and used a 20-marker multiplex to analyse samples that were centrally prepared and thoroughly tested prior to shipment. Specimens of increasing complexity were assessed that ranged from reference PCR products, cDNAs of indicated or unnamed cell type source(s), to challenging mock casework stains. From this specimen set, information on the overall sensitivity and specificity of the various markers was obtained. In addition, the reliability of a scoring system for inference of cell types was assessed. This scoring system builds on replicate RNA analyses and the ratio observed/possible peaks for each cell type [1]. The results of the exercise support the usefulness of this scoring system. When interpreting the data obtained from the analysis of the mock casework stains, the participating laboratories were asked to integrate the DNA and RNA results and associate donor and cell type where possible. A large variation for the integrated interpretations of the DNA and RNA data was obtained including correct interpretations. We infer that with expertise in analysing RNA profiles, clear guidelines for data interpretation and awareness regarding potential pitfalls in associating donors and cell types, mRNA-based cell type inference can be implemented for forensic casework.},

abstract = {DNA profiles can be used as evidence to distinguish between possible donors of a crime stain. In some cases, both the prosecution and the defence claim that the cell material was left by the suspect but they dispute which cell type was left behind. For example, in sexual offense cases the prosecution could claim that the sample contains semen cells where the defence argues that the sample contains skin cells. In these cases, traditional methods (e.g. a phosphatase test) can be used to examine the cell type contained in the sample. However, there are some drawbacks when using these methods. For instance, many of these techniques need to be carried out separately for each cell type and each of them requires part of the available sample, which reduces the amount that can be used for DNA analysis. Another option is messenger RNA (mRNA) evidence. mRNA expression levels vary among cell types and can be used to make (probability) statements about the cell type(s) present in a sample. Existing methods for the interpretation of RNA profiles as evidence for the presence of certain cell types aim at making categorical statements. Such statements limit the possibility to report the associated uncertainty. Some of these existing methods will be discussed. Most notably, a method based on a 'n/2' scoring rule (Lindenbergh et al.) and a method using marker values and cell type scoring thresholds (Roeder et al.). From a statistical point of view, a probabilistic approach is the most obvious choice. Two approaches (multinomial logistic regression and naïve Bayes') are suggested. All methods are compared, using two different datasets and several criteria regarding their ability to assess the evidential value of RNA profiles. We conclude that both the naïve Bayes' method and a method based on multinomial logistic regression, that produces a probabilistic statement as measure of the evidential value, are an important improvement of the existing methods. Besides a better performance, they are flexible and can be adapted to other situations. For example, they could potentially assist in the combination of RNA with DNA evidence.},

abstract = {In forensic case investigations involving human traces, cell type identification has become increasingly important. No longer only the donor of a trace (sub-source level), but also the actions which could have led to the deposition of the trace ('beyond-the-source'/activity level) need to be evaluated by forensic experts. For this evaluation determining the cellular source of a DNA profile can be beneficial. In this report two criminal cases are described where both human STR profiling and microbial population profiling were applied to the same trace sample. Human STR profiling was used to evaluate the sub-source question and microbial population profiling was used to evaluate the source question. The Bayesian framework was used to evaluate the evidence.},

abstract = {Identifying the biological origin of forensic traces can provide crucial evidence to aid criminal investigations. Current forensic practice for the identification of body fluids mostly uses protein-based presumptive tests. Such tests cannot identify all of the forensically relevant fluids and have issues of cross-reactivity. More recently, messenger RNA methods have been developed that have expanded the range of body fluids that can be positively identified. However, these methods are slow and require expert scientists to run the processes and interpret the results. The ParaDNA® Body Fluid ID System has been designed to provide a simple, fast and robust way to identify forensically relevant body fluids in a lab or field-deployable manner. The system can analyse and detect mRNA targets for six different body fluids: vaginal fluid, seminal fluid, sperm cells, saliva, menstrual blood and peripheral blood. Utilising the ParaDNA Sample Collector and instruments, minimal training is required to enable both forensic scientists and non-specialist personnel to analyse biological samples directly, without prior sample processing, in approximately 90 min. The developmental validation studies described here were designed to address requirements of end users, based on the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) guidelines, and tested the sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy, inhibitor tolerance, and performance of the ParaDNA Body Fluid ID System on a range of mock evidence items. The data collected demonstrate that the Body Fluid ID System can automatically determine the presence of specific body fluid mRNA markers in single-source and mixed samples on multiple substrate types and body fluids could be identified with as little as 0.05ng total RNA and 1μl of the relevant fluid. Results can either be used to support confirmation of source from previously obtained STR DNA profiling results or to improve sample success rates by making better informed evidential submissions.},

abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression varies among cell types; therefore, analyses for the presence of particular mRNAs can be used to identify biological fluids in forensic samples. For this work, several novel markers were characterized for saliva, cervicovaginal fluid (CVF), blood, and menstrual blood (MB). The new markers were used in combination with previously described markers to develop four multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays. These multiplexes incorporate two housekeeping and a minimum of five markers for each of the following forensically relevant body fluids: semen, saliva, CVF, blood, and MB. A large number of samples (>200) were analyzed to determine specificity of each marker. The majority of the markers were detected at low frequencies in non-target body fluids. Because markers were not specific to their respective target body fluids, a scoring system was developed to minimize the chances of misidentification of a sample due to marker expression in a non-target body fluid. Each marker was given a numerical value related to its “correct” (target body fluid) versus “incorrect” (non-target body fluid) expression in samples of known origin. For each of the five body fluids, the marker values of those mRNA markers that were present in a sample were added to produce a body fluid score. Threshold scores were then determined for the identification of each body fluid. Although this study highlights the complexity of body fluid identification, particularly in differentiating blood and MB, the use of threshold scores allowed for reliable body fluid identification in the samples tested.},

abstract = {Human blood traces are amongst the most commonly encountered biological stains collected at crime scenes. Identifying the body site of origin of a forensic blood trace can provide crucial information in many cases, such as in sexual and violent assaults. However, means for reliably and accurately identifying from which body site a forensic blood trace originated are missing, but would be highly valuable in crime scene investigations. With this study, we introduce a taxonomy-independent deep neural network approach based on massively parallel microbiome sequencing, which delivers accurate body site of origin classification of forensically-relevant blood samples, such as menstrual, nasal, fingerprick, and venous blood. A total of 50 deep neural networks were trained using a large 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset from 773 reference samples, including 220 female urogenital tract, 190 nasal cavity, 213 skin, and 150 venous blood samples. Validation was performed with de-novo generated 16S rRNA gene massively parallel sequencing (MPS) data from 94 blood test samples of four different body sites, and achieved high classification accuracy with AUC values at 0.992 for menstrual blood (N = 23), 0.978 for nasal blood (N = 16), 0.978 for fingerprick blood (N = 30), and 0.990 for venous blood (N = 25). The obtained highly accurate classification of menstrual blood was independent of the day of the menses, as established in additional 86 menstrual blood test samples. Accurate body site of origin classification was also revealed for 45 fresh and aged mock casework blood samples from all four body sites. Our novel microbiome approach works based on the assumption that a sample is from blood, as can be obtained in forensic practise from prior presumptive blood testing, and provides accurate information on the specific body source of blood, with high potentials for future forensic applications.},

abstract = {: Forensic applications of RNA analysis have included body fluid identification and analysis of RNA degradation in aged stains as a possible indicator of time. With respect to age estimation of a stain through RNA analysis, a full understanding of the patterns and rates of RNA degradation in postmortem samples and body fluid stains is lacking. In this study, mRNA degradation in fresh and aged body fluid stains (blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid) was analyzed utilizing next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The global abundance of transcripts present in each of the different stains decreased with time. However, within the global population, specific transcripts disappeared from RNA extracts with differing rates. For example, a positive correlation was observed between the initial abundance of a typical transcript and the time it could no longer be detected in the RNA-seq results. In other words, the greater the initial transcript abundance, the longer it could be detected with RNA-seq. Transcripts, of the same time zero abundance, that nonetheless disappeared from the transcriptome at different time points during storage could be readily identified and were members of transcript groups common to all body fluid stains as well as groups whose presence was restricted among body fluids. A possible relationship between transcript length and longevity during storage was investigated, and no significant correlation was found. Results of this study will contribute to our understanding of mRNA degradation in forensically relevant body fluid stains in ways that may lead to developing a tool to estimate the age of a stain at a crime scene.},

abstract = {In recent years, forensic mRNA profiling has increasingly been used to identify the origin of human body fluids. By now, several laboratories have implemented mRNA profiling and also use it in criminal casework. In 2018 the FoRNAP (Forensic RNA Profiling) group was established among a number of these laboratories with the aim of sharing experiences, discussing optimization potential, identifying challenges and suggesting solutions with regards to mRNA profiling and casework. To compare mRNA profiling methods and results a collaborative exercise was organized within the FoRNAP group. Seven laboratories from four countries received 16 stains, comprising six pure body fluid / tissue stains and ten mock casework samples. The laboratories were asked to analyze the provided stains with their in-house method (PCR/CE or MPS) and markers of choice. Five laboratories used a DNA/RNA co-extraction strategy. Overall, up to 11 mRNA markers per body fluid were analyzed. We found that mRNA profiling using different extraction and analysis methods as well as different multiplexes can be applied to casework-like samples. In general, high input samples were typed with high accuracy by all laboratories, regardless of the method used. Irrespective of the analysis strategy, samples of low input or mixed stains were more challenging to analyze and interpret since, alike to DNA profiling, a higher number of markers dropped out and/or additional unexpected markers not consistent with the cell type in question were detected. It could be shown that a plethora of different but valid analysis and interpretation strategies exist and are successfully applied in the Forensic Genetics community. Nevertheless, efforts aiming at optimizing and harmonizing interpretation approaches in order to achieve a higher consistency between laboratories might be desirable in the future. The simultaneous extraction of DNA alongside RNA showed to be an effective approach to identify not only the body fluid present but also to identify the donor(s) of the stain. This allows investigators to gain valuable information about the origin of crime scene samples and the course of events in a crime case.},

Several alternative methods for body fluid prediction have been proposed to improve the currently used presumptive tests. Most of them measure gene expression. Here we present a novel approach based on microbial taxonomic profiles obtained by standard 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We used saliva deposited on skin as a forensically relevant study model, but the same principle can be applied for predicting other bacteria rich body fluids. For classification we used standard pattern recognition based on principal component analysis in combination with linear discriminant analysis. A cross-validation of the experimental data shows that the new method is able to successfully classify samples from saliva deposited on skin and samples from pure skin in 94% of the cases. We found that there is a person-effect influencing the result, especially from skin, indicating that a reference sample of pure skin microbiota from the same person could improve accuracy. In addition the pattern recognition methods could be further optimized. Although there is room for improvement, this study shows the potential of microbial profiles as a new forensic tool for body fluid prediction.},

abstract = {The European DNA profiling group (EDNAP) organized a sixth collaborative exercise on RNA/DNA co-analysis for body fluid/tissue identification and STR profiling. The task was to identify skin samples/contact traces using specific RNA biomarkers and test three housekeeping genes for their suitability as reference genes. Eight stains, a skin RNA dilution series and, optionally, bona fide or mock casework samples of human or non-human origin were analyzed by 22 participating laboratories using RNA extraction or RNA/DNA co-extraction methods. Two sets of previously described skin-specific markers were used: skin1 pentaplex (LCE1C, LCE1D, LCE2D, IL1F7 and CCL27) and skin2 triplex (LOR, KRT9 and CDSN) in conjunction with a housekeeping gene, HKG, triplex (B2M, UBC and UCE). The laboratories used different chemistries and instrumentation. All laboratories were able to successfully isolate and detect mRNA in contact traces (e.g., human skin, palm-, hand- and fingerprints, clothing, car interiors, computer accessories and electronic devices). The simultaneous extraction of RNA and DNA provides an opportunity for positive identification of the tissue source of origin by mRNA profiling as well as a simultaneous identification of the body fluid donor by STR profiling. The skin markers LCE1C and LOR and the housekeeping gene marker B2M were detected in the majority of contact traces. Detection of the other markers was inconsistent, possibly due to the low amounts and/or poor quality of the genetic material present in shed skin cells. The results of this and the previous collaborative RNA exercises support RNA profiling as a reliable body fluid/tissue identification method that can easily be combined with current STR typing technology.},

abstract = {From the perspective of forensics genetics, the human microbiome is a rich, relatively untapped resource for human identity testing. Since it varies within and among people, and perhaps temporally, the potential forensic applications of the use of the microbiome can exceed that of human identification. However, the same inherent variability in microbial distributions may pose a substantial barrier to forming predictions on an individual as the source of the microbial sample unless stable signatures of the microbiome are identified and targeted. One of the more commonly adopted strategies for microbial human identification relies on quantifying which taxa are present and their respective abundance levels. It remains an open question if such microbial signatures are more individualizing than estimates of the degree of genetic relatedness between microbial samples. This study attempts to address this question by contrasting two prediction strategies. The first approach uses phylogenetic distance to predict the host individual; thus it operates under the premise that microbes within individuals are more closely related than microbes between/among individuals. The second approach uses population genetic measures of diversity at clade-specific markers, serving as a fine-grained assessment of microbial composition and quantification. Both assessments were performed using targeted sequencing of 286 markers from 22 microbial taxa sampled in 51 individuals across three body sites measured in triplicate. Nearest neighbor and reverse nearest neighbor classifiers were constructed based on the pooled data and yielded 71% and 78% accuracy, respectively, when diversity was considered, and performed significantly worse when a phylogenetic distance was used (54% and 63% accuracy, respectively). However, empirical estimates of classification accuracy were 100% when conditioned on a maximum nearest neighbor distance when diversity was used, while identification based on a phylogenetic distance failed to reach saturation. These findings suggest that microbial strain composition is more individualizing than that of a phylogeny, perhaps indicating that microbial composition may be more individualizing than recent common ancestry. One inference that may be drawn from these findings is that host-environment interactions may maintain the targeted microbial profile and that this maintenance may not necessarily be repopulated by intra-individual microbial strains.},

abstract = {In criminal investigations there are some cases in which identifying the presence of vaginal secretions provides crucial evidence in proving sexual assault. However, there are no methods for definitively identifying vaginal secretions. In the present study, we focused on Lactobacillus levels in vaginal secretions and developed a novel identification method for vaginal secretions by relative quantification based on real time PCR. We designed a Lactobacillus conserved region primer pair (LCP) by aligning 16S rRNA gene sequences from major vaginal Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners and Lactobacillus jensenii), and selected the human specific primer pair (HSP) as an endogenous control for relative quantification. As a result, the ΔCt (ΔCt=Ct[LCP]-Ct[HSP]) values of vaginal secretions (11 out of 12 samples) were significantly lower than those of saliva, semen and skin surface samples, and it was possible to discriminate between vaginal secretions and other body fluids. For the one remaining sample, it was confirmed that the predominant species in the microflora was not of the Lactobacillus genus. The ΔCt values in this study were calculated when the total DNA input used from the vaginal secretions was 10pg or more. Additionally, the ΔCt values of samples up to 6-months-old, which were kept at room temperature, remained unchanged. Thus, we concluded in this study that the simple ΔCt method by real time PCR is a useful tool for detecting the presence of vaginal secretions.},

abstract = {In the forensic reconstruction of crime scene activities, the identification of biological traces and their bodily origin are valuable evidence that can be presented in court. While several presumptive and confirmatory tests are currently available, the limitations in specificity and sensitivity have instigated a search for alternative methods. Bacterial markers have been proposed as a novel approach for forensic body fluid/tissue identification. Bacteria are not only ubiquitous throughout the human body, but also, as shown by recent microbiome sequencing studies of the 16S rRNA gene, bacterial community structures are distinct across body sites. Traces and stains at crime scenes are, however, often exposed to the environment outside the human body for variable periods of time before laboratory processing. Thus, it is not clear whether exposed samples continue to harbor microbial signatures characteristic of their body site of origin. In this proof-of-concept study we collected samples from six different body sites: saliva, skin, peripheral blood, vaginal fluid, menstrual blood and semen. We exposed a subset of these samples to indoor conditions for 30 days while the remaining samples were processed directly after extraction. Our analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequence data for a total of 46 control and exposed samples show that both types of samples group by body site, although a few outliers are observed. Based on our results, vaginal and menstrual samples share their microbial signatures, and cannot be distinguished using bacterial markers. Overall, our findings indicate that bacterial markers are a promising avenue for forensic body fluid/tissue identification.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe identification of body site-specific microbial biomarkers and their use for classification tasks have promising applications in medicine, microbial ecology, and forensics. Previous studies have characterized site-specific microbiota and shown that sample origin can be accurately predicted by microbial content. However, these studies were usually restricted to single datasets with consistent experimental methods and conditions, as well as comparatively small sample numbers. The effects of study-specific biases and statistical power on classification performance and biomarker identification thus remain poorly understood. Furthermore, reliable detection in mixtures of different body sites or with noise from environmental contamination has rarely been investigated thus far. Finally, the impact of ecological associations between microbes on biomarker discovery was usually not considered in previous work.ResultsHere we present the analysis of one of the largest cross-study sequencing datasets of microbial communities from human body sites (15,082 samples from 57 publicly available studies). We show that training a Random Forest Classifier on this aggregated dataset increases prediction performance for body sites by 35% compared to a single-study classifier. Using simulated datasets, we further demonstrate that the source of different microbial contributions in mixtures of different body sites or with soil can be detected starting at 1% of the total microbial community. We apply a biomarker selection method that excludes indirect environmental associations driven by microbe-microbe associations, yielding a parsimonious set of highly predictive taxa including novel biomarkers and excluding many previously reported taxa. We find a considerable fraction of unclassified biomarkers (“microbial dark matter”) and observe that negatively associated taxa have a surprisingly high impact on classification performance. We further detect a significant enrichment of rod-shaped, motile, and sporulating taxa for feces biomarkers, consistent with a highly competitive environment.ConclusionsOur machine learning model shows strong body site classification performance, both in single-source samples and mixtures, making it promising for tasks requiring high accuracy, such as forensic applications. We report a core set of ecologically informed biomarkers, inferred across a wide range of experimental protocols and conditions, providing the most concise, general, and least biased overview of body site-associated microbes to date.},

url = {},
abstract = {A DNA profile from the perpetrator does not reveal, per se, the circumstances by which it was transferred. Body fluid identification by mRNA profiling may allow extraction of contextual 'activity level' information from forensic samples. Here we describe the development of a prototype multiplex digital gene expression (DGE) method for forensic body fluid/tissue identification based upon solution hybridization of color-coded NanoString(®) probes to 23 mRNA targets. The method identifies peripheral blood, semen, saliva, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin. We showed that a simple 5 min room temperature cellular lysis protocol gave equivalent results to standard RNA isolation from the same source material, greatly enhancing the ease-of-use of this method in forensic sample processing. We first describe a model for gene expression in a sample from a single body fluid and then extend that model to mixtures of body fluids. We then describe calculation of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of body fluid quantities in a sample, and we describe the use of likelihood ratios to test for the presence of each body fluid in a sample. Known single source samples of blood, semen, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin all demonstrated the expected tissue-specific gene expression for at least two of the chosen biomarkers. Saliva samples were more problematic, with their previously identified characteristic genes exhibiting poor specificity. Nonetheless the most specific saliva biomarker, HTN3, was expressed at a higher level in saliva than in any of the other tissues. Crucially, our algorithm produced zero false positives across this study's 89 unique samples. As a preliminary indication of the ability of the method to discern admixtures of body fluids, five mixtures were prepared. The identities of the component fluids were evident from the gene expression profiles of four of the five mixtures. Further optimization of the biomarker 'CodeSet' will be required before it can be used in casework, particularly with respect to increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the saliva biomarkers. With suitable modifications, this simplified protocol with minimal hands on requirement should facilitate routine use of mRNA profiling in casework laboratories.},

The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the RNA degradation pattern of forensically relevant body fluids and to find candidate markers for TsD estimation. Blood, menstrual blood, saliva, semen and vaginal secretion samples were exposed to indoor (dark, room temperature) and outdoor (exposed to sun, wind, etc. but protected from rain) conditions for up to 1.5 years. Based on expression and degradation analyses, we were able to identify body fluid specific signatures and RNA degradation patterns. The indoor samples showed a marked drop in RNA integrity after 6 months, while the outdoor samples were difficult to interpret and therefore excluded for some of the analyses. Up to 4 weeks, indoor samples showed more stable and less degrading transcripts than outdoor samples. Stable transcripts tended to be significantly shorter than degrading ones or transcripts, which are neither degrading nor stable. We reinforced the body fluid specific and the housekeeping gene nature of previously reported markers. With an unbiased approach, we selected stable and degrading genes for each body fluid in the short term and assessed their integrity during extended storage. We identified several stable and degrading gene transcripts, which could be tested in a targeted assay to assess the TsD interval e.g. by analyzing the ratio of degrading vs stable transcripts. In conclusion, we were able to detect RNA degradation patterns in samples being aged up to 1.5 years and identified several candidate markers, which could be evaluated for TsD estimation.},

Previous studies have reported that DNA methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial DNA can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. In the present study, a method for detecting bacterial DNA was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. The developed multiplex PCR was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by including amplicons for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. Using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the USP49, DACT1, and PFN3 tDMRs and by hypermethylation at L81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria, Veillonella atypica and/or Streptococcus salivarius. Additionally, vaginal fluid and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the PFN3 tDMR and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, Lactobacillus crispatus and/or Lactobacillus gasseri. Because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of DNA for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid in one PCR reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The human microbiome contributes significantly to the genetic content of the human body. Genetic and environmental factors help shape the microbiome, and as such, the microbiome can be unique to an individual. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential to use microbiome profiling for forensic applications; however, a method has yet to identify stable features of skin microbiomes that produce high classification accuracies for samples collected over reasonably long time intervals. A novel approach is described here to classify skin microbiomes to their donors by comparing two feature types: Propionibacterium acnes pangenome presence/absence features and nucleotide diversities of stable clade-specific markers. Supervised learning was used to attribute skin microbiomes from 14 skin body sites from 12 healthy individuals sampled at three time points over a >2.5-year period with accuracies of up to 100% for three body sites. Feature selection identified a reduced subset of markers from each body site that are highly individualizing, identifying 187 markers from 12 clades. Classification accuracies were compared in a formal model testing framework, and the results of this analysis indicate that learners trained on nucleotide diversity perform significantly better than those trained on presence/absence encodings. This study used supervised learning to identify individuals with high accuracy and associated stable features from skin microbiomes over a period of up to almost 3 years. These selected features provide a preliminary marker panel for future development of a robust and reproducible method for skin microbiome profiling for forensic human identification. IMPORTANCE A novel approach is described to attribute skin microbiomes, collected over a period of >2.5 years, to their individual hosts with a high degree of accuracy. Nucleotide diversities of stable clade-specific markers with supervised learning were used to classify skin microbiomes from a particular individual with up to 100% classification accuracy for three body sites. Attribute selection was used to identify 187 genetic markers from 12 clades which provide the greatest differentiation of individual skin microbiomes from 14 skin sites. This study performs skin microbiome profiling from a supervised learning approach and obtains high classification accuracy for samples collected from individuals over a relatively long time period for potential application to forensic human identification.},

abstract = {Microbiome research is a highly transdisciplinary field with a wide range of applications and methods for studying it, involving different computational approaches and models. The fact that different people host radically different microbiota highlights forensic perspectives in understanding what leads to this variation and what regulates it, in order to effectively use microbes as forensic evidence. This narrative review provides an overview of some of the main scientific works so far produced, focusing on the potentiality of using skin microbiome profiling for human identification in forensics. This review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The examined literature clearly ascertains that skin microbial communities, although personalized, vary systematically across body sites and time, with intrapersonal differences over time smaller than interpersonal ones, showing such a high degree of spatial and temporal variability that the degree and nature of this variability can constitute in itself an important parameter useful in distinguishing individuals from one another. Even making the effort to organically synthesize all results achieved until now, it is quite evident that these results are still the pieces of a puzzle, which is not yet complete.},

abstract = {Information on the time when a stain was deposited at a crime scene can be valuable in forensic investigations. It can link a DNA-identified stain donor with a crime or provide a post-mortem interval estimation in cases with cadavers. The available methods for estimating stain deposition time have limitations of different types and magnitudes. In this proof-of-principle study we investigated for the first time the use of microbial DNA for this purpose in human saliva stains. First, we identified the most abundant and frequent bacterial species in saliva using publicly available 16S rRNA gene next generation sequencing (NGS) data from 1,848 samples. Next, we assessed time-dependent changes in 15 identified species using de-novo 16S rRNA gene NGS in the saliva stains of two individuals exposed to indoor conditions for up to 1 year. We selected four bacterial species, i.e., Fusobacterium periodonticum, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Veillonella dispar, and Veillonella parvula showing significant time-dependent changes and developed a 4-plex qPCR assay for their targeted analysis. Then, we analyzed the saliva stains of 15 individuals exposed to indoor conditions for up to 1 month. Bacterial counts generally increased with time and explained 54.9% of the variation (p = <2.2E–16). Time since deposition explained ≥86.5% and ≥88.9% of the variation in each individual and species, respectively (p = <2.2E–16). Finally, based on sample duplicates we built and tested multiple linear regression models for predicting the stain deposition time at an individual level, resulting in an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 5 days (ranging 3.3–7.8 days). Overall, the deposition time of 181 (81.5%) stains was correctly predicted within 1 week. Prediction models were also assessed in stains exposed to similar conditions up to 1 month 7 months later, resulting in an average MAE of 8.8 days (ranging 3.9–16.9 days). Our proof-of-principle study suggests the potential of the DNA profiling of human commensal bacteria as a method of estimating saliva stains time since deposition in the forensic scenario, which may be expanded to other forensically relevant tissues. The study considers practical applications of this novel approach, but various forensic developmental validation and implementation criteria will need to be met in more dedicated studies in the future.},

abstract = {A third collaborative exercise on RNA/DNA co-analysis for body fluid identification and STR profiling was organized by the European DNA Profiling Group (EDNAP). Twenty saliva and semen stains, four dilution series (10-0.01 μl saliva, 5-0.01 μl semen) and, optionally, bona fide or mock casework samples of human or non-human origin were analyzed by 20 participating laboratories using an RNA extraction or RNA/DNA co-extraction method. Two novel mRNA multiplexes were used: a saliva triplex (HTN3, STATH and MUC7) and a semen pentaplex (PRM1, PRM2, PSA, SEMG1 and TGM4). The laboratories used different chemistries and instrumentation and a majority (16/20) were able to successfully isolate and detect mRNA in dried stains. The simultaneous extraction of RNA and DNA from individual stains not only permitted a confirmation of the presence of saliva/semen (i.e. tissue/fluid source of origin), but allowed an STR profile of the stain donor to be obtained as well. The method proved to be reproducible and sensitive, with as little as 0.05 μl saliva or semen, using different analysis strategies. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability to positively identify the presence of saliva and semen, as well as obtain high quality DNA profiles, from old and compromised casework samples. The results of this collaborative exercise involving an RNA/DNA co-extraction strategy support the potential use of an mRNA based system for the identification of saliva and semen in forensic casework that is compatible with current DNA analysis methodologies.},

The resulting data set was used to build a probabilistic model that predicts the origin of a stain.

The model differs from the ones previously suggested in that it incorporates quantitative information (NGS read counts) rather than just presence/absence of markers. The suggested approach also allows for visualisation of important markers and their correlation with the different body fluids. We compared our model to previously published methods to show that the inclusion of read count information improves the prediction.

abstract = {Human identification has played a prominent role in forensic science for the past two decades. Identification based on unique genetic traits is driving the field. However, this may have limitations, for instance, for twins. Moreover, high-throughput sequencing techniques are now available and may provide a high amount of data likely useful in forensic science. This study investigates the potential for bacteria found in the salivary microbiome to be used to differentiate individuals. Two different targets (16S rRNA and rpoB) were chosen to maximise coverage of the salivary microbiome and when combined, they increase the power of differentiation (identification). Paired-end Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to analyse the bacterial composition of saliva from two different people at four different time points (t = 0 and t = 28 days and then one year later at t = 0 and t = 28 days). Five major phyla dominate the samples: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. Streptococcus, a Firmicutes, is one of the most abundant aerobic genera found in saliva and targeting Streptococcus rpoB has enabled a deeper characterisation of the different streptococci species, which cannot be differentiated using 16S rRNA alone. We have observed that samples from the same person group together regardless of time of sampling. The results indicate that it is possible to distinguish two people using the bacterial microbiota present in their saliva.},

abstract = {Current body fluid identification methods do not reveal any information about the time since deposition (TsD) of biological traces, even though determining the age of traces could be crucial for the investigative process. To determine the utility of microbial RNA markers for TsD estimation, we examined RNA sequencing data from five forensically relevant body fluids (blood, menstrual blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretion) over seven time points, ranging from fresh to 1.5 years. One set of samples was stored indoors while another was exposed to outdoor conditions. In outdoor samples, we observed a consistent compositional shift, occurring after 4 weeks: this shift was characterized by an overall increase in non-human eukaryotic RNA and an overall decrease in prokaryotic RNA. In depth analyses showed a high fraction of tree, grass and fungal signatures, which are characteristic for the environment the samples were exposed to. When examining the prokaryotic fraction in more detail, three bacterial phyla were found to exhibit the largest changes in abundance, namely Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. More detailed analyses at the order level were done using a Lasso regression analysis to find a predictive subset of bacterial taxa. We found 26 bacterial orders to be indicative of sample age. Indoor samples did not reveal such a clear compositional change at the domain level: eukaryotic and prokaryotic abundance remained relatively stable across the assessed time period. Nonetheless, a Lasso regression analysis identified 32 bacterial orders exhibiting clear changes over time, enabling the prediction of TsD. For both indoor and outdoor samples, a larger number (around 60%) of the bacterial orders identified as indicative of TsD are part of the Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. In summary, we found that the observed changes across time are not primarily due to changes associated with body fluid specific bacteria but mostly due to accumulation of bacteria from the environment. Orders of these environmental bacteria could be evaluated for TsD prediction, considering the location and environment of the crime scene. However, further studies are needed to verify these findings, determine the applicability across samples, replicates, donors, and other variables, and also to further assess the effect of different seasons and locations on the samples.},

abstract = {The recovery of a DNA profile from the perpetrator or victim in criminal investigations can provide valuable 'source level' information for investigators. However, a DNA profile does not reveal the circumstances by which biological material was transferred. Some contextual information can be obtained by a determination of the tissue or fluid source of origin of the biological material as it is potentially indicative of some behavioral activity on behalf of the individual that resulted in its transfer from the body. Here, we sought to improve upon established RNA based methods for body fluid identification by developing a targeted multiplexed next generation mRNA sequencing assay comprising a panel of approximately equal sized gene amplicons. The multiplexed biomarker panel includes several highly specific gene targets with the necessary specificity to definitively identify most forensically relevant biological fluids and tissues (blood, semen, saliva, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin). In developing the biomarker panel we evaluated 66 gene targets, with a progressive iteration of testing target combinations that exhibited optimal sensitivity and specificity using a training set of forensically relevant body fluid samples. The current assay comprises 33 targets: 6 blood, 6 semen, 6 saliva, 4 vaginal secretions, 5 menstrual blood and 6 skin markers. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and the ability to identify body fluids in single source and admixed stains. A 16 sample blind test was carried out by one lab with samples provided by the other participating lab. The blinded lab correctly identified the body fluids present in 15 of the samples with the major component identified in the 16th. Various classification methods are being investigated to permit inference of the body fluid/tissue in dried physiological stains. These include the percentage of reads in a sample that are due to each of the 6 tissues/body fluids tested and inter-sample differential gene expression revealed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering.},

abstract = {The value of RNA analysis in the forensic laboratory as one means of identifying the nature of biological evidence of forensic relevance has been well established. The degradation of RNA in dried body fluid stains has also been an area of forensic interest because of the potential to estimate the age of a stain recovered from a crime scene. Here we describe a qPCR assay that demonstrates it is possible to estimate the age of bloodstains with reasonable accuracy. The 5'-3' qPCR assay exploits the observation the 5' end of an mRNA transcript degrades in dried stains faster than the 3' end. This differential degradation pattern can be followed with a qPCR assay that quantifies ∼90 bp amplicons produced from the 5' and 3' ends of 4 transcripts chosen from the transcriptome of blood because of their degradation kinetics, determined initially using RNA sequencing. Statistical analysis of degradation kinetics suggests, depending upon the age of the sample, the age of blood stains can be accurately estimated to within 2-4 weeks for stains less than 6 months of age and 4-6 weeks for stains 6 months to 1 year old.},

In this study, we developed a method to efficiently determine the C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype composition from microbial samples taken from the hands of participants and from their possessions. Using the C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype composition, we could predict the owner of a possession with around 90% accuracy when the 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome profile was included. We also showed that the C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype composition was more stable over time than the skin microbiome profile and thus is more suitable for owner identification. ABSTRACT The human skin surface harbors huge numbers of microbes. The skin microbiota interacts with its host and forms a skin microbiome profile that is specific for each individual. It has been reported that the skin microbiota that is left on an individual’s possessions can act as a sort of “fingerprint” and be used for owner identification. However, this approach needs to be improved to take into account any long-term instability of skin microbiota and contamination from nonspecific bacteria. Here, we took advantage of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 16S-encoding rRNA gene of Cutibacterium acnes, the most common and abundant bacterium on human skin, to perform owner identification. We first developed a high-throughput genotyping method based on next-generation sequencing to characterize the SNPs of the C. acnes 16S rRNA gene and found that the genotype composition of C. acnes 16S rRNA is individual specific. Owner identification accuracy of around 90% based on random forest machine learning was achieved by using a combination of C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype and skin microbiome profile data. Furthermore, our study showed that the C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype remained more stable over time than the skin microbiome profile. This characteristic of C. acnes was further confirmed by the analysis of publicly available human skin metagenome data. Our approach, with its high precision, good reproducibility, and low costs, thus provides new possibilities in the field of microbiome-based owner identification and forensics in general.

Both their high abundance, microbes outnumber human cells by a factor 10, and their diversity, different sites of the human body harbour different microbial communities, make them an interesting tool for forensics. Faecal material is a type of trace evidence which can be found in a variety of criminal cases, but is often being ignored in forensic investigations. Deriving a human short tandem repeat (STR) profile from a faecal sample can be challenging. However, the microbial communities within faecal material can be of additional criminalistic value in linking a faecal trace to the possible donor. We present a microarray technique in which the faecal microbial community is used to differentiate between faecal samples and developed a decision model to predict the possible common origin of questioned samples. The results show that this technique may be a useful additional tool when no or only partial human STR profiles can be generated.},

abstract = {The human skin microbiome can vary over time, and inter-individual variability of the microbiome is greater than the temporal variability within an individual. The skin microbiome has become a useful tool to identify individuals, and one type of personal identification using the skin microbiome has been reported in a community of less than 20 individuals. However, identification of individuals based on the skin microbiome has shown low accuracy in communities larger than 80 individuals. Here, we developed a new approach for personal identification, which considers that minor taxa are one of the important factors for distinguishing between individuals. We originally established a human skin microbiome for 66 samples from 11 individuals over two years (33 samples each year). Our method could classify individuals with 85% accuracy beyond a one-year sampling period. Moreover, we applied our method to 837 publicly available skin microbiome samples from 89 individuals and succeeded in identifying individuals with 78% accuracy. In short, our results investigate that (i) our new personal identification method worked well with two different communities (our data: 11 individuals; public data: 89 individuals) using the skin microbiome, (ii) defining the personal skin microbiome requires samples from several time points, (iii) inclusion of minor skin taxa strongly contributes to the effectiveness of personal identification.},
