abstract = {Abstract With the rapid accumulation of microbiome data around the world, numerous computational bioinformatics methods have been developed for pattern mining from such paramount microbiome data. Current microbiome data mining methods, such as gene and species mining, rely heavily on sequence comparison. Most of these methods, however, have a clear trade-off, particularly, when it comes to big-data analytical efficiency and accuracy. Microbiome entities are usually organized in ontology structures, and pattern mining methods that have considered ontology structures could offer advantages in mining efficiency and accuracy. Here, we have summarized the ontology-aware neural network (ONN) as a novel framework for microbiome data mining. We have discussed the applications of ONN in multiple contexts, including gene mining, species mining and microbial community dynamic pattern mining. We have then highlighted one of the most important characteristics of ONN, namely, novel knowledge discovery, which makes ONN a standout among all microbiome data mining methods. Finally, we have provided several applications to showcase the advantage of ONN over other methods in microbiome data mining. In summary, ONN represents a paradigm shift for pattern mining from microbiome data: from traditional machine learning approach to ontology-aware and model-based approach, which has found its broad application scenarios in microbiome data mining.},

abstract = {Habitat specific patterns reflected by microbial communities, as well as complex interactions between the community and their environments or hosts’ characteristics, have created obstacles for microbial source tracking: diverse and context-dependent applications are asking for quantification of the contributions of different niches (biomes), which have already overwhelmed existing methods. Moreover, existing source tracking methods could not extend well for source tracking samples from understudied biomes, as well as samples from longitudinal studies. Here, we introduce EXPERT (https://github.com/HUST-NingKang-Lab/EXPERT), an exact and pervasive expert model for source tracking microbial communities based on transfer learning. Built upon the biome ontology information and transfer learning techniques, EXPERT has acquired the context-aware flexibility and could easily expand the supervised model’s search scope to include the context-dependent community samples and understudied biomes. While at the same time, it is superior to current approaches in source tracking accuracy and speed. EXPERT’s superiority has been demonstrated on multiple source tracking tasks, including source tracking samples collected at different disease stages and longitudinal samples. For example, when dealing with 635 samples from a recent study of colorectal cancer, EXPERT could achieve an AUROC of 0.977 when predicting the host’s phenotypical status. In summary, EXPERT has unleashed the potential of model-based source tracking approaches, enabling source tracking in versatile context-dependent settings, accomplishing pervasive and in-depth knowledge discovery from microbiome.},

abstract = {The taxonomical structure of microbial community sample is highly habitat-specific, making it possible for source tracking niches where samples are originated. Current methods face challenges when the number of samples and niches are magnitudes more than current in use, under which circumstances they are unable to accurately source track samples in a timely manner, rendering them difficult in knowledge discovery from sub-million heterogeneous samples. Here, we introduce a deep learning method based on Ontology-aware Neural Network approach, ONN4MST (https://github.com/HUST-NingKang-Lab/ONN4MST), which takes into consideration the ontology structure of niches and the relationship of samples from these ontologically-organized niches. ONN4MST’s superiority in accuracy, speed and robustness have been proven, for example with an accuracy of 0.99 and AUC of 0.97 in a microbial source tracking experiment that 125,823 samples and 114 niches were involved. Moreover, ONN4MST has been utilized on several source tracking applications, showing that it could provide highly-interpretable results from samples with previously less-studied niches, detect microbial contaminants, and identify similar samples from ontologically-remote niches, with high fidelity.},

In this thesis, I develop a new tool MIDAS (Metagenomic Intra-species Diversity Analysis System) for rapidly and automatically quantifying species abundance, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and gene copy number variants (CNVs) from metagenomes. To illustrate the utility of this approach, I reanalyze three public datasets with MIDAS. First, I re-analyze stool metagenomes from 98 mother-infant pairs and used rare SNPs to track strain transmission. I find that early colonizers are likely transmitted from the mother whereas late colonizers are likely transmitted from the environment. Second, I re-analyze g300 stool metagenomes from healthy adults and use SNPs to identify examples of both strain co-existence and strain coexclusion. Third, I re-analyze 198 globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene copy number variants to show that many species have population structure that correlates with geographic location. Strain level genetic variants clearly reveal extensive structure and dynamics that are obscured when metagenomes are analyzed at coarser taxonomic resolution.},

abstract = {We present the Metagenomic Intra-species Diversity Analysis System (MIDAS), which is an integrated computational pipeline for quantifying bacterial species abundance and strain-level genomic variation, including gene content and single nucleotide polymorphisms, from shotgun metagenomes. Our method leverages a database of >30,000 bacterial reference genomes which we clustered into species groups. These cover the majority of abundant species in the human microbiome but only a small proportion of microbes in other environments, including soil and seawater. We applied MIDAS to stool metagenomes from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants over one year and used rare single nucleotide variants to reveal extensive vertical transmission of strains at birth but colonization with strains unlikely to derive from the mother at later time points. This pattern was missed with species-level analysis, because the infant gut microbiome composition converges towards that of an adult over time. We also applied MIDAS to 198 globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene content to show that many prevalent bacterial species have population structure that correlates with geographic location. Strain-level genetic variants present in metagenomes clearly reveal extensive structure and dynamics that are obscured when data is analyzed at a higher taxonomic resolution.},

abstract = {Little is known regarding the impact of immigrant acculturation on the gut microbiome. We characterized differences in the gut microbiome between racially/ethnically diverse US immigrant and US-born groups, and determined the impact of dietary acculturation on the microbiome. Stool samples were collected from 863 US residents, including US-born (315 White, 93 Black, 40 Hispanic) and foreign-born (105 Hispanic, 264 Korean) groups. We determined dietary acculturation from dissimilarities based on food frequency questionnaires, and used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiome. Gut microbiome composition differed across study groups, with the largest difference between foreign-born Koreans and US-born Whites, and significant differences also observed between foreign-born and US-born Hispanics. Differences in sub-operational taxonomic unit (s-OTU) abundance between foreign-born and US-born groups tended to be distinct from differences between US-born groups. Bacteroides plebeius, a seaweed-degrading bacterium, was strongly enriched in foreign-born Koreans, while Prevotella copri and Bifidobacterium adolescentis were strongly enriched in foreign-born Koreans and Hispanics, compared with US-born Whites. Dietary acculturation in foreign-born participants was associated with specific s-OTUs, resembling abundance in US-born Whites; e.g., a Bacteroides plebeius s-OTU was depleted in highly diet-acculturated Koreans. In summary, we observed that US nativity is a determinant of the gut microbiome in a US resident population. Dietary acculturation may result in loss of native species in immigrants, though further research is necessary to explore whether acculturation-related microbiome alterations have consequences for immigrant health.},

However, with more studies on enterotypes conducted nowadays, doubts about the existence and robustness of enterotypes have also emerged. Here we reviewed current opinions about enterotypes from both conceptual and analytical points of view. We firstly illustrated the definition of the enterotype and various factors influencing enterotypes, such as diet, administration of antibiotics, and age. Then we summarized lines of evidence that pose the concept against the enterotype, and described the current methods for enterotype analysis. Finally, we showed that the concept of enterotype has been extended to other ecological niches. Based on current studies on enterotypes, it has been clear that more studies with larger sample sizes are needed to characterize the enterotypes. Improved computational methods are also required to build sophisticated models, reflecting the dynamics and resilience of enterotypes.},

However, it is a very difficult computational challenge to identify similar samples, as well as identify their likely origins, among such a grand pool of samples from all around the world. Currently, several approaches have already been proposed for such a challenge, based on either distance calculation, unsupervised algorithms, or supervised algorithms. These methods have advantages and disadvantages for the different settings of comparisons and searches, and their results are also drastically different. In this review, we systematically compared distance-based, unsupervised, and supervised methods for microbiome sample comparison and search. Firstly, we assessed their accuracy and efficiency, both in theory and in practice. Then we described the scenarios in which one or multiple methods were applicable for sample searches. Thirdly, we provided several applications for microbiome sample comparisons and searches, and provided suggestions on the choice of methods. Finally, we provided several perspectives for the future development of microbiome sample comparison and search, including deep learning technologies for tracking the sources of microbiome samples.},

abstract = {With the rapid increase in sequencing data, human host status inference (e.g. healthy or sick) from microbiome data has become an important issue. Existing studies are mostly based on single-point microbiome composition, while it is rare that the host status is predicted from longitudinal microbiome data. However, single-point-based methods cannot capture the dynamic patterns between the temporal changes and host status. Therefore, it remains challenging to build good predictive models as well as scaling to different microbiome contexts. On the other hand, existing methods are mainly targeted for disease prediction and seldom investigate other host statuses. To fill the gap, we propose a comprehensive deep learning-based framework that utilizes longitudinal microbiome data as input to infer the human host status. Specifically, the framework is composed of specific data preparation strategies and a recurrent neural network tailored for longitudinal microbiome data. In experiments, we evaluated the proposed method on both semi-synthetic and real datasets based on different sequencing technologies and metagenomic contexts. The results indicate that our method achieves robust performance compared to other baseline and state-of-the-art classifiers and provides a significant reduction in prediction time.},

abstract = {Human gut microbiomes consist of a large number of microbial genomes, which vary by diet and health conditions and from individual to individual. In the present work, we asked whether such variation or similarity could be measured and, if so, whether the results could be used for personal microbiome identification (PMI). To address this question, we herein propose a method to estimate the significance of similarity among human gut metagenomic samples based on reference-free, long k-mer features. Using these features, we find that pairwise similarities between the metagenomes of any two individuals obey a beta distribution and that a p value derived accordingly well characterizes whether two samples are from the same individual or not. We develop a computational framework called GePMI (Generating inter-individual similarity distribution for Personal Microbiome Identification) and apply it to several human gut metagenomic datasets (>300 individuals and >600 samples in total). From the results of GePMI, most of the human gut microbiomes can be identified (auROC = 0.9470, auPRC = 0.8702). Even after antibiotic treatment or fecal microbiota transplantation, the individual k-mer signature still maintains a certain specificity.Gut microbes: Identifying our personal microbiomesA computational method for processing the results of genetic analysis of gut microbes can discriminate between and identify the microbes populating different individuals. The pool of microbial genomes in the gut — the gut microbiome — comes from many different microbes. Researchers and clinicians are keenly investigating the significance of these gut microbes in health and disease. Ting Chen and Rui Jiang at Tsinghua University in Beijing, with co-workers elsewhere in China and in Israel, developed a method they call ‘Generating inter-individual similarity distribution for Personal Microbiome Identification’ (GePMI) to classify microbiomes. The procedure can reliably identify different people’s microbiomes, even after antibiotic treatment or the administration of donor microbes in fecal transplantation. GePMI will help monitor the variation among microbiomes and hopefully reveal associations linking gut microbes with specific diseases.},

abstract = {Motivation Metagenomics is the study of microbiomes using DNA sequencing. A microbiome consists of an assemblage of microbes that is associated with a “theater of activity” (ToA). To what degree does the taxonomic and functional content of the former depend on the (details of the) latter? More technically, given a taxonomic and/or functional profile estimated from metagenomic sequencing data, how to predict the associated ToA? Here we present a deep learning approach to this question. We use both taxonomic and functional profiles as input. We apply node2vec to embed hierarchical taxonomic profiles into numerical vectors. We then perform dimension reduction using clustering, to address the sparseness of the taxonomic data and thus make it more amenable to deep learning algorithms. Functional features are combined with textual descriptions of protein families or domains. We present an ensemble deep-learning framework DeepToA for predicting the ‘theater of activity” of microbial community, based on taxonomic and functional profiles. We use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to determine which taxonomic and functional features are important for the prediction. Results Based on 7,560 metagenomic profiles downloaded from MGnify, classified into ten different theaters of activity, we demonstrate that DeepToA has an accuracy of 98.61%. We show that adding textual information to functional features increases the accuracy. Availability Our approach is available at http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/software/deeptoa.

Although a classical concept in ecology, niche breadth has remained challenging to quantify because it depends on an objective definition of the environment. Here, by defining the environment of a microbe as the community it resides in, we integrated information from over 22 thousand environmental sequencing samples to derive a quantitative social niche breadth score for all microbial taxa. At the level of genera, we explored niche range strategies across the tree of life. We found that generalists include opportunists that stochastically dominate local communities, while specialists are stable but low in abundance. Generalists have a more diverse and open pan genome than specialists, but we found no global correlation between niche breadth and genome size. Instead, we observed two distinct evolutionary strategies, where specialists have relatively small genomes in habitats with low local diversity, but relatively large genomes in habitats with high local diversity. Together, our global analysis shines a new, data-driven light on microbial niche range strategies.},

Additionally, altered gut microbiome modulates immunity, bringing about health implications in humans. To explore the effects of the mid-term travel on the gut microbiome, we generated 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing data from longitudinal samples collected over six months. We monitored dynamic trajectories of the gut microbiome variation of a Chinese volunteer team (VT) in their whole journey to Trinidad and Tobago (TAT). We found gut microbiome resilience that VT’s gut microbial compositions gradually transformed to the local TAT’s enterotypes during their six-month stay in TAT, and then reverted to their original enterotypes after VT’s return to Beijing in one month. Moreover, we identified driven species in this bi-directional plasticity that could play a role in immunity modulation, as exemplified by Bacteroides dorei that attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation and effectively suppressed proinflammatory immune response. Another driven species P. copri could play a crucial role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, a chronic autoimmune disease. Carbohydrate-active enzymes are often implicated in immune and host-pathogen interactions, of which glycoside hydrolases were found decreased but glycosyltransferases and carbohydrate esterases increased during the travel; these functions were then restored after VT’ returning to Beijing. Furthermore, we discovered these microbial changes and restoration were mediated by VT people’s dietary changes. These findings indicate that half-year travel leads to change in enterotype and functional patterns, exerting effects on human health. Microbial intervention by dietary guidance in half-year travel would be conducive to immunity modulation for maintaining health.},

abstract = {The taxonomic structure of microbial community sample is highly habitat-specific, making source tracking possible, allowing identification of the niches where samples originate. However, current methods face challenges when source tracking is scaled up.

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Subspecies identification is one of the most critical issues in microbiome studies, as it is directly related to their functions in response to the environmental stress and their feedbacks. However, identification of subspecies remains a challenge largely due to the small variation between different strains within the same species. Accurate identification of subspecies primarily relies on variant identification and categorization through microbiome data. However, current SNP calling and subspecies identification for microbiome data remain underdeveloped.


RESULTS
In this work, we have proposed Strain-GeMS for subspecies identification from microbiome data, based on solid statistical model for SNP calling, as well as optimized procedure for subspecies identification. Results on simulated, ab initio and in vivo datasets have shown that Strain-GeMS could always generate more accurate results compared with other subspecies identification methods.

Here we study the impact of confined and controlled swine farm environments on temporal changes in the gut microbiome and resistome of veterinary students with occupational exposure for 3 months. By analyzing 16S rRNA and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing data in tandem with culture-based methods, we show that farm exposure shapes the gut microbiome of students, resulting in enrichment of potentially pathogenic taxa and antimicrobial resistance genes. Comparison of students’ gut microbiomes and resistomes to farm workers’ and environmental samples revealed extensive sharing of resistance genes and bacteria following exposure and after three months of their visit. Notably, antibiotic resistance genes were found in similar genetic contexts in student samples and farm environmental samples. Dynamic Bayesian network modeling predicted that the observed changes partially reverse over a 4-6 month period. Our results indicate that acute changes in a human’s living environment can persistently shape their gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome. Environments where antibiotics are used indiscriminately exhibit microbial communities that can represent hot-spots of resistance gene enrichment, which in turn could spread to humans. Here, the authors characterize how exposure to swine farms environment lead to temporal changes in the gut microbiome and resistome of healthy veterinary students.},

We applied MIDAS to stool metagenomes from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants over one year and used rare SNPs to track strains between hosts. Using this approach, we found that although species compositions of mothers and infants converged over time, strain-level similarity diverged. Specifically, early colonizing bacteria were often transmitted from an infant's mother, while late colonizing bacteria were often transmitted from other sources in the environment and were enriched for spore-formation genes. We also applied MIDAS to 198 globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene content to show that many prevalent bacterial species have population structure that correlates with geographic location. Strain-level genetic variants present in metagenomes clearly reveal extensive structure and dynamics that are obscured when data are analyzed at a coarser taxonomic resolution.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Gut microbial communities of athletes differ from that of sedentary persons in both diversity and the presence of certain taxa. However, it is unclear to what degree elite athletes and non-elite athletes harbor different gut microbial community patterns and if we can effectively monitor the potential of athletes based on microbiota. A team of professional female rowing athletes in China was recruited and 306 fecal samples were collected from 19 individuals, which were separated into three cohorts: adult elite athlete’s (AE), youth elite athlete’s (YE), and youth non-elite athlete’s (YN). The differences in gut microbiome among different cohorts were compared, and their associations with dietary factors, physical characteristics, and athletic performance were investigated. The microbial diversities of elite athletes were higher than those of youth non-elite athletes. The taxonomical, functional, and phenotypic compositions of AE, YE and YN were significantly different. Additionally, three enterotypes with clear separation were identified in athlete’s fecal samples, with majority of elite athletes stratified into enterotype 3. And this enterotype-dependent gut microbiome is strongly associated with athlete performances. These differences in athlete gut microbiota lead to establishment of a random forest classifier based on taxonomical and functional biomarkers, capable of differentiating elite athletes and non-elite athletes with high accuracy. Finally, these versatilities of athlete microbial communities of athletes were found to be associated with dietary factors and physical characteristics, which can in concert explain 41% of the variability in gut microbiome.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Research shows that human microbiome is highly dynamic on longitudinal timescales, changing dynamically with diet, or due to medical interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework "phyLoSTM", using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) for feature extraction and analysis of temporal dependency in longitudinal microbiome sequencing data along with host's environmental factors for disease prediction. Additional novelty in terms of handling variable timepoints in subjects through LSTMs, as well as, weight balancing between imbalanced cases and controls is proposed.


RESULTS
We simulated 100 datasets across multiple time points for model testing. To demonstrate the model's effectiveness, we also implemented this novel method into two real longitudinal human microbiome studies: (i) DIABIMMUNE three country cohort with food allergy outcomes (Milk, Egg, Peanut and Overall) (ii) DiGiulio study with preterm delivery as outcome. Extensive analysis and comparison of our approach yields encouraging performance with an AUC of 0.897 (increased by 5%) on simulated studies and AUCs of 0.762 (increased by 19%) and 0.713 (increased by 8%) on the two real longitudinal microbiome studies respectively, as compared to the next best performing method, Random Forest. The proposed methodology improves predictive accuracy on longitudinal human microbiome studies containing spatially correlated data, and evaluates the change of microbiome composition contributing to outcome prediction.

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have emerged in pathogens and spread faster than expected, arousing a worldwide concern. Current methods are suitable mainly for the discovery of close homologous ARGs and have limited utility for discovery of novel ARGs, thus rendering the profiling of ARGs incomprehensive. Here, an ontology-aware deep learning model, ONN4ARG (http://onn4arg.xfcui.com/), is proposed for the discovery of novel ARGs based on multi-level annotations. Experiments based on billions of candidate microbial genes collected from various environments show the superiority of ONN4ARG in comprehensive ARG profiling. Enrichment analyses show that ARGs are both environment-specific and host-specific. For example, resistance genes for rifamycin, which is an important antibacterial agent active against gram-positive bacteria, are enriched in Actinobacteria and in soil environment. Case studies verified ONN4ARG’s ability for novel ARG discovery. For example, a novel streptomycin resistance gene was discovered from oral microbiome samples and validated through wet-lab experiments. ONN4ARG provides a complete picture of the prevalence of ARGs in microbial communities as well as guidance for detection and reduction of the spread of resistance genes.},

abstract = {Among the various parameters obtainable through the analysis of the human gut microbiota, the enterotype is one of the first classifications of the bacterial consortia, which tried to obtain, at the same time, as much information as possible to be applied in clinical medicine. Although some authors observed the existence not of clusters, but only of a real continuous gradient, enterotypes are commonly described according to various models. The first model predicted either clustering into enterotypes 1 and 2 based on two specific dominances, Bacteroides and Prevotella, respectively, with the Ruminococcus dominance blurred within the Bacteroides dominance, or it predicted a threedominant condition, in which the Ruminococcus driver constituted enterotype 3, separated from enterotype 1. A second model envisaged three possible ways to cluster gut microbiota, respectively centred on two, three, and four dominances. In the first case, enterotypes 1 and 2 coincided with the two original enterotypes, with the dominance of Bacteroides and Prevotella, respectively. In the second case, the existence of enterotype 3 was evident and whose dominance was not centred on Ruminococcus but extended more towards the entire Firmicutes phylum. In the third case, the presence of the phylum Firmicutes was split into two different enterotypes generating the clusters defined and named as Mixtures 1 and 2. Subsequently, the analysis of the water content (hydration) in the stool allowed the splitting of the Bacteroides enterotype into two sub-enterotype, respectively known as B1 and B2. All these models have allowed us to highlight some correlations between a specific enterotype, or cluster, and some characteristics, such as the greater predisposition of the respective hosts towards certain pathologies. These observations, coupled with the attempt to derive the different microbiota on an evolutionary basis, can help to shed new light on this topic and demonstrate the possible utility that the different ways of clustering the gut microbiota can have in a clinical application perspective and in preventive medicine.},

Our research team has obtained a catalogue of isolated and typified strains from microbiota showing resistance to dietary contaminants and obesogens. Special attention was paid to cultivable Bacillus species as potential next-generation probiotics (NGP) together with their antimicrobial production and ecological impacts. The objective of the present work focused on bioinformatic genome data mining and phenotypic analyses for antimicrobial production. In silico methods were applied over the phylogenetically closest type strain genomes of the microbiota Bacillus spp. isolates and standardized antimicrobial production procedures were used. The main results showed partial and complete gene identification and presence of polyketide (PK) clusters on the whole genome sequences (WGS) analysed. Moreover, specific antimicrobial effects against B. cereus, B. circulans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Salmonella spp. confirmed their capacity of antimicrobial production. In conclusion, Bacillus strains isolated from human gut microbiota and taxonomic group, resistant to Bisphenols as xenobiotics type endocrine disruptors, showed parallel PKS biosynthesis and a phenotypic antimicrobial effect. This could modulate the composition of human gut microbiota and therefore its functionalities, becoming a predominant group when high contaminant exposure conditions are present.},

abstract = {The issue of what factors shape the gut microbiota has been studied for years. However, questions on the contribution of host genetics to the colonizing process of the gut microbiota and to the extent that host genetics affect the gut microbiota have not yet been clearly answered. Most recently published reports have concluded that host genetics make a smaller contribution than other factors, such as diet, in determining the gut microbiota. Here we have exploited the increasing amount of fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing data that are becoming available to conduct an analysis to assess the influence of host genetics on the diversity of the gut microbiota. By re-analyzing data obtained from over 5000 stool samples, representing individuals living on five continents and ranging in age from 3 days to 87 years, we found that the strength of the various factors affecting the membership or structure of the gut microbiota are quite different, which leads us to a hypothesis that the presence or absence of taxa is largely controlled by host genetics, whereas non-genetic factors regulate the abundance of each taxon. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the genome similarity positively correlates with the similarity of community membership. Finally, we showed that only severe perturbations are able to alter the gut microbial community membership. In summary, our work provides new insights into understanding the complexities of the gut microbial community and how it responds to changes imposed on it.},

There is an urgent need to better understand the contributions of novel, potentially uncultured, diarrheal pathogens to severe diarrheal disease, as well as distortions in normal gut microbiota composition that might facilitate severe disease.ResultsWe use high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare fecal microbiota composition in children under five years of age who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe diarrhea (MSD) with the microbiota from diarrhea-free controls. Our study includes 992 children from four low-income countries in West and East Africa, and Southeast Asia. Known pathogens, as well as bacteria currently not considered as important diarrhea-causing pathogens, are positively associated with MSD, and these include Escherichia/Shigella, and Granulicatella species, and Streptococcus mitis/pneumoniae groups. In both cases and controls, there tend to be distinct negative correlations between facultative anaerobic lineages and obligate anaerobic lineages. Overall genus-level microbiota composition exhibit a shift in controls from low to high levels of Prevotella and in MSD cases from high to low levels of Escherichia/Shigella in younger versus older children; however, there was significant variation among many genera by both site and age.ConclusionsOur findings expand the current understanding of microbiota-associated diarrhea pathogenicity in young children from developing countries.

abstract = {CONTEXT
Previous population studies in evaluating the beneficial effects of capsaicin (CAP) have yielded inconclusive results, and the mechanisms responsible for possible benefit remain unclear.


OBJECTIVE
The objective was to assess the effect of dietary CAP on metabolic and immune profiles and its potential associations with gut microbial patterns in healthy adults.


DESIGN
In a 6-week controlled feeding trial, subjects were given the weight maintenance diet sequentially contained with 0, 5, 0, and 10 mg/d CAP from chili powder.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
The study was conducted in 12 healthy subjects enrolled in Third Military Medical University in Chongqing.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
At the end of each period, anthropometric and basal metabolism measures together with blood and fecal samples were collected. Plasma metabolic and inflammatory markers and gut microbial ecology of each subject were subsequently assessed.


RESULT
Dietary CAP increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Faecalibacterium abundance, accompanied with increased plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide and decreased plasma ghrelin level. Further enterotype analysis revealed that these subjects could be clustered into Bacteroides enterotype (E1) and Prevotella enterotype (E2), and the above beneficial effects were mainly obtained in E1 subjects. Moreover, E1 subjects had significantly higher fecal Faecalibacterium abundance and butyrate concentration after CAP interventions than those in E2 subjects.


CONCLUSION
Our study showed that gut enterotypes may influence the beneficial effects of dietary CAP, providing new evidence for the personalized nutrition guidance of CAP intervention on health promotion linking with gut microbiota patterns.},

abstract = {The role of intestinal Prevotella species in human health is controversial, with both positive and negative associations. Strain-level diversity may contribute to discrepancies in genus and species associations with health and disease. We dissected the gut metagenomes of Italians with varying dietary habits, investigating the presence of distinct Prevotella copri strains. Fiber-rich diets were linked to P. copri types with enhanced potential for carbohydrate catabolism. P. copri strains associated with an omnivore diet had a higher prevalence of the leuB gene-involved in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis-a risk factor for glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes. These P. copri pangenomes were compared to existing cohorts, providing evidence of distinct gene repertoires characterizing different P. copri populations, with drug metabolism and complex carbohydrate degradation significantly associated with Western and non-Western individuals, respectively. Strain-level P. copri diversity in gut microbiomes is affected by diet and should be considered when examining host-microbe associations.},

abstract = {Host genetics, environment, lifestyle and proximity between hosts strongly influence the composition of the gut microbiome. To investigate the association of dietary variables with the gut microbiota, we used 16S rDNA sequencing to test the fecal microbiome of Bedouins and urban Saudis and we compared it to the gut microbiome of baboons living in close contact with Bedouins and eating their leftovers. We also analyzed fermented dairy products commonly consumed by Bedouins in order to investigate their impact on the gut microbiome of this population. We found that the gut microbiomes of westernized urban Saudis had significantly lower richness and biodiversity than the traditional Bedouin population. The gut microbiomes of baboons were more similar to that of Bedouins compared to urban Saudis, probably due the dietary overlap between baboons and Bedouins. Moreover, we found clusters that were compositionally similar to clusters identified in humans and baboons, characterized by differences in Acinetobacter, Turicibacter and Collinsella. The fermented food presented significantly more bacteria genera common to the gut microbiome of Bedouins compared to urban Saudis. These results support the hypothesis that dietary habits influence the composition of the gut microbiome.},

abstract = {Chemical risk assessment in the context of the risk analysis framework was initially designed to evaluate the impact of hazardous substances or xenobiotics on human health. As the need of multiple stressors assessment was revealed to be more reliable regarding the occurrence and severity of the adverse effects in the exposed organisms, the cumulative risk assessment started to be the recommended approach. As toxicant mixtures and their “cocktail effects” are considered to be main hazards, the most important exposure for these xenobiotics would be of dietary and environmental origin. In fact, even a more holistic prism should currently be considered. In this sense, the definition of One Health refers to simultaneous actions for improving human, animal, and environmental health through transdisciplinary cooperation. Global policies necessitate going beyond the classical risk assessment for guaranteeing human health through actions and implementation of the One Health approach. In this context, a new perspective is proposed for the integration of microbiome biomarkers and next generation probiotics potentially impacting and modulating not only human health, but plant, animal health, and the environment.},

abstract = {Integrated data from molecular and improved culturomics studies might offer holistic insights on gut microbiome dysbiosis triggered by xenobiotics, such as obesity and metabolic disorders. Bisphenol A (BPA), a dietary xenobiotic obesogen, was chosen for a directed culturing approach using microbiota specimens from 46 children with obesity and normal-weight profiles. In parallel, a complementary molecular analysis was carried out to estimate the BPA metabolising capacities. Firstly, catalogues of 237 BPA directed-cultured microorganisms were isolated using five selected media and several BPA treatments and conditions. Taxa from Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant in normal-weight and overweight/obese children, with species belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Clostridium. Secondly, the representative isolated taxa from normal-weight vs. overweight/obese were grouped as BPA biodegrader, tolerant, or resistant bacteria, according to the presence of genes encoding BPA enzymes in their whole genome sequences. Remarkably, the presence of sporobiota and concretely Bacillus spp. showed the higher BPA biodegradation potential in overweight/obese group compared to normal-weight, which could drive a relevant role in obesity and metabolic dysbiosis triggered by these xenobiotics.},

abstract = {Objectives: Previous studies have reported that the gut microbiome has an important link with the development of hypertension. Though previous researches have focused on the links of gut bacteria with hypertension, little has been known about the linkage of gut viruses to hypertension and the development of hypertension, largely due to the lack of data mining tools for such investigation. In this work, we have analyzed 196 fecal metagenomic data related to hypertension aiming to profile the gut virome and link the gut virome to pre-hypertension and hypertension. Design: Here, we have applied a statistically sound method for mining of gut virome data and linking gut virome to hypertension. We characterized the viral composition and bacterial composition of 196 samples, identified the viral-type of each sample and linked gut virome to hypertension. Results: We stratified these 196 fecal samples into two viral-types and selected 32 viruses as the biomarkers for these groups. We found that viruses could have a superior resolution and discrimination power than bacteria for differentiation of healthy samples and pre-hypertension samples, as well as hypertension samples. Moreover, as to the co-occurrence networks linking viruses and bacteria, we found increasingly pervasive virus-bacteria linkages from healthy people to pre-hypertension people to hypertension patients. Conclusion: Overall, our results have shown ample indications of the link between human gut virome and hypertension, and could help provide microbial solutions toward early diagnoses of hypertension.},
