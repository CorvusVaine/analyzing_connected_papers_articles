abstract = {Abstract Background Phages and plasmids are the major components of mobile genetic elements, and fragments from such elements generally co-exist with chromosome-derived fragments in sequenced metagenomic data. However, there is a lack of efficient methods that can simultaneously identify phages and plasmids in metagenomic data, and the existing tools identifying either phages or plasmids have not yet presented satisfactory performance. Findings We present PPR-Meta, a 3-class classifier that allows simultaneous identification of both phage and plasmid fragments from metagenomic assemblies. PPR-Meta consists of several modules for predicting sequences of different lengths. Using deep learning, a novel network architecture, referred to as the Bi-path Convolutional Neural Network, is designed to improve the performance for short fragments. PPR-Meta demonstrates much better performance than currently available similar tools individually for phage or plasmid identification, while testing on both artificial contigs and real metagenomic data. PPR-Meta is freely available via http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/ZhuLab/PPR_Meta or https://github.com/zhenchengfang/PPR-Meta. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, PPR-Meta is the first tool that can simultaneously identify phage and plasmid fragments efficiently and reliably. The software is optimized and can be easily run on a local PC by non-computer professionals. We developed PPR-Meta to promote the research on mobile genetic elements and horizontal gene transfer.},

abstract = {Abstract Plasmid ATLAS (pATLAS, http://www.patlas.site) provides an easy-to-use web accessible database with visual analytics tools to explore the relationships of plasmids available in NCBI’s RefSeq database. pATLAS has two main goals: (i) to provide an easy way to search for plasmids deposited in NCBI RefSeq and their associated metadata; (ii) to visualize the relationships of plasmids in a graph, allowing the exploration of plasmid evolution. pATLAS allows searching by plasmid name, bacterial host taxa, antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, plasmid families, and by sequence length and similarity. pATLAS is also able to represent in the plasmid network, plasmid sets identified by external pipelines using mapping, mash screen or assembly from high-throughput sequencing data. By representing the identified hits within the network of relationships between plasmids, allowing the possibility of removing redundant results, and by taking advantage of the browsing capabilities of pATLAS, users can more easily interpret the pipelines’ results. All these analyses can be saved to a JSON file for sharing and future re-evaluation. Furthermore, by offering a REST-API, the pATLAS database and network display are easily accessible by other interfaces or pipelines.},

abstract = {Ocean microbes drive biogeochemical cycling on a global scale. However, this cycling is constrained by viruses that affect community composition, metabolic activity, and evolutionary trajectories. Owing to challenges with the sampling and cultivation of viruses, genome-level viral diversity remains poorly described and grossly understudied, with less than 1% of observed surface-ocean viruses known. Here we assemble complete genomes and large genomic fragments from both surface- and deep-ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina research expeditions, and analyse the resulting ‘global ocean virome’ dataset to present a global map of abundant, double-stranded DNA viruses complete with genomic and ecological contexts. A total of 15,222 epipelagic and mesopelagic viral populations were identified, comprising 867 viral clusters (defined as approximately genus-level groups). This roughly triples the number of known ocean viral populations and doubles the number of candidate bacterial and archaeal virus genera, providing a near-complete sampling of epipelagic communities at both the population and viral-cluster level. We found that 38 of the 867 viral clusters were locally or globally abundant, together accounting for nearly half of the viral populations in any global ocean virome sample. While two-thirds of these clusters represent newly described viruses lacking any cultivated representative, most could be computationally linked to dominant, ecologically relevant microbial hosts. Moreover, we identified 243 viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes, of which only 95 were previously known. Deeper analyses of four of these auxiliary metabolic genes (dsrC, soxYZ, P-II (also known as glnB) and amoC) revealed that abundant viruses may directly manipulate sulfur and nitrogen cycling throughout the epipelagic ocean. This viral catalog and functional analyses provide a necessary foundation for the meaningful integration of viruses into ecosystem models where they act as key players in nutrient cycling and trophic networks.},

abstract = {Background The recent development of metagenomic sequencing makes it possible to massively sequence microbial genomes including viral genomes without the need for laboratory culture. Existing reference-based and gene homology-based methods are not efficient in identifying unknown viruses or short viral sequences from metagenomic data. Methods Here we developed a reference-free and alignment-free machine learning method, DeepVirFinder, for identifying viral sequences in metagenomic data using deep learning. Results Trained based on sequences from viral RefSeq discovered before May 2015, and evaluated on those discovered after that date, DeepVirFinder outperformed the state-of-the-art method VirFinder at all contig lengths, achieving AUROC 0.93, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.98 for 300, 500, 1000, and 3000 bp sequences respectively. Enlarging the training data with additional millions of purified viral sequences from metavirome samples further improved the accuracy for identifying virus groups that are under-represented. Applying DeepVirFinder to real human gut metagenomic samples, we identified 51,138 viral sequences belonging to 175 bins in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Ten bins were found associated with the cancer status, suggesting viruses may play important roles in CRC. Conclusions Powered by deep learning and high throughput sequencing metagenomic data, DeepVirFinder significantly improved the accuracy of viral identification and will assist the study of viruses in the era of metagenomics.},

abstract = {Metagenomics has enabled sequencing of viral communities from a myriad of different environments. Viral metagenomic studies routinely uncover sequences with no recognizable homology to known coding regions or genomes. Nevertheless, complete viral genomes have been constructed directly from complex community metagenomes, often through tedious manual curation. To address this, we developed the software tool virMine to identify viral genomes from raw reads representative of viral or mixed (viral and bacterial) communities. virMine automates sequence read quality control, assembly, and annotation. Researchers can easily refine their search for a specific study system and/or feature(s) of interest. In contrast to other viral genome detection tools that often rely on the recognition of viral signature sequences, virMine is not restricted by the insufficient representation of viral diversity in public data repositories. Rather, viral genomes are identified through an iterative approach, first omitting non-viral sequences. Thus, both relatives of previously characterized viruses and novel species can be detected, including both eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages. Here we present virMine and its analysis of synthetic communities as well as metagenomic data sets from three distinctly different environments: the gut microbiota, the urinary microbiota, and freshwater viromes. Several new viral genomes were identified and annotated, thus contributing to our understanding of viral genetic diversity in these three environments.},

abstract = {Viruses and their host genomes often share similar oligonucleotide frequency (ONF) patterns, which can be used to predict the host of a given virus by finding the host with the greatest ONF similarity. We comprehensively compared 11 ONF metrics using several k-mer lengths for predicting host taxonomy from among ∼32 000 prokaryotic genomes for 1427 virus isolate genomes whose true hosts are known. The background-subtracting measure [Formula: see text] at k = 6 gave the highest host prediction accuracy (33%, genus level) with reasonable computational times. Requiring a maximum dissimilarity score for making predictions (thresholding) and taking the consensus of the 30 most similar hosts further improved accuracy. Using a previous dataset of 820 bacteriophage and 2699 bacterial genomes, [Formula: see text] host prediction accuracies with thresholding and consensus methods (genus-level: 64%) exceeded previous Euclidian distance ONF (32%) or homology-based (22-62%) methods. When applied to metagenomically-assembled marine SUP05 viruses and the human gut virus crAssphage, [Formula: see text]-based predictions overlapped (i.e. some same, some different) with the previously inferred hosts of these viruses. The extent of overlap improved when only using host genomes or metagenomic contigs from the same habitat or samples as the query viruses. The [Formula: see text] ONF method will greatly improve the characterization of novel, metagenomic viruses.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Prokaryotic viruses referred to as phages can be divided into virulent and temperate phages. Distinguishing virulent and temperate phage–derived sequences in metavirome data is important for elucidating their different roles in interactions with bacterial hosts and regulation of microbial communities. However, there is no experimental or computational approach to effectively classify their sequences in culture-independent metavirome. We present a new computational method, DeePhage, which can directly and rapidly judge each read or contig as a virulent or temperate phage–derived fragment. Findings DeePhage uses a “one-hot” encoding form to represent DNA sequences in detail. Sequence signatures are detected via a convolutional neural network to obtain valuable local features. The accuracy of DeePhage on 5-fold cross-validation reaches as high as 89%, nearly 10% and 30% higher than that of 2 similar tools, PhagePred and PHACTS. On real metavirome, DeePhage correctly predicts the highest proportion of contigs when using BLAST as annotation, without apparent preferences. Besides, DeePhage reduces running time vs PhagePred and PHACTS by 245 and 810 times, respectively, under the same computational configuration. By direct detection of the temperate viral fragments from metagenome and metavirome, we furthermore propose a new strategy to explore phage transformations in the microbial community.

abstract = {Background Viruses are a significant player in many biosphere and human ecosystems, but most signals remain “hidden” in metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequence datasets due to the lack of universal gene markers, database representatives, and insufficiently advanced identification tools. Results Here, we introduce VirSorter2, a DNA and RNA virus identification tool that leverages genome-informed database advances across a collection of customized automatic classifiers to improve the accuracy and range of virus sequence detection. When benchmarked against genomes from both isolated and uncultivated viruses, VirSorter2 uniquely performed consistently with high accuracy (F1-score > 0.8) across viral diversity, while all other tools under-detected viruses outside of the group most represented in reference databases (i.e., those in the order Caudovirales ). Among the tools evaluated, VirSorter2 was also uniquely able to minimize errors associated with atypical cellular sequences including eukaryotic genomes and plasmids. Finally, as the virosphere exploration unravels novel viral sequences, VirSorter2’s modular design makes it inherently able to expand to new types of viruses via the design of new classifiers to maintain maximal sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion With multi-classifier and modular design, VirSorter2 demonstrates higher overall accuracy across major viral groups and will advance our knowledge of virus evolution, diversity, and virus-microbe interaction in various ecosystems.

abstract = {BackgroundViruses are important components of microbial communities modulating community structure and function; however, only a couple of tools are currently available for phage identification and analysis from metagenomic sequencing data. Here we employed the random forest algorithm to develop VirMiner, a web-based phage contig prediction tool especially sensitive for high-abundances phage contigs, trained and validated by paired metagenomic and phagenomic sequencing data from the human gut flora.ResultsVirMiner achieved 41.06% ± 17.51% sensitivity and 81.91% ± 4.04% specificity in the prediction of phage contigs. In particular, for the high-abundance phage contigs, VirMiner outperformed other tools (VirFinder and VirSorter) with much higher sensitivity (65.23% ± 16.94%) than VirFinder (34.63% ± 17.96%) and VirSorter (18.75% ± 15.23%) at almost the same specificity. Moreover, VirMiner provides the most comprehensive phage analysis pipeline which is comprised of metagenomic raw reads processing, functional annotation, phage contig identification, and phage-host relationship prediction (CRISPR-spacer recognition) and supports two-group comparison when the input (metagenomic sequence data) includes different conditions (e.g., case and control). Application of VirMiner to an independent cohort of human gut metagenomes obtained from individuals treated with antibiotics revealed that 122 KEGG orthology and 118 Pfam groups had significantly differential abundance in the pre-treatment samples compared to samples at the end of antibiotic administration, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), multidrug resistance, and protein transport.

abstract = {Microbiomes from every environment contain a myriad of uncultivated archaeal and bacterial viruses, but studying these viruses is hampered by the lack of a universal, scalable taxonomic framework. We present vConTACT v.2.0, a network-based application utilizing whole genome gene-sharing profiles for virus taxonomy that integrates distance-based hierarchical clustering and confidence scores for all taxonomic predictions. We report near-identical (96%) replication of existing genus-level viral taxonomy assignments from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses for National Center for Biotechnology Information virus RefSeq. Application of vConTACT v.2.0 to 1,364 previously unclassified viruses deposited in virus RefSeq as reference genomes produced automatic, high-confidence genus assignments for 820 of the 1,364. We applied vConTACT v.2.0 to analyze 15,280 Global Ocean Virome genome fragments and were able to provide taxonomic assignments for 31% of these data, which shows that our algorithm is scalable to very large metagenomic datasets. Our taxonomy tool can be automated and applied to metagenomes from any environment for virus classification.Classification of archaeal and bacterial viruses can be automated with an algorithm that identifies relationships on the basis of shared gene content.},

abstract = {The recent development of metagenomic sequencing makes it possible to sequence microbial genomes including viruses in an environmental sample. Identifying viral sequences from metagenomic data is critical for downstream virus analyses. The existing reference-based and gene homology-based methods are not efficient in identifying unknown viruses or short viral sequences. Here we have developed a reference-free and alignment-free machine learning method, DeepVirFinder, for predicting viral sequences in metagenomic data using deep learning techniques. DeepVirFinder was trained based on a large number of viral sequences discovered before May 2015. Evaluated on the sequences after that date, DeepVirFinder outperformed the state-of-the-art method VirFinder at all contig lengths. Enlarging the training data by adding millions of purified viral sequences from environmental metavirome samples significantly improves the accuracy for predicting under-represented viruses. Applying DeepVirFinder to real human gut metagenomic samples from patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) identified 51,138 viral sequences belonging to 175 bins. Ten bins were associated with the cancer status, indicating their potential use for non-invasive diagnosis of CRC. In summary, DeepVirFinder greatly improved the precision and recall rates of viral identification, and it will significantly accelerate the discovery rate of viruses.},

abstract = {AMGARTEN, D. Machine Learning Prediction in Genomic Sequences of Prokaryotic Viruses from Metagenomic Datasets. 2021. 79 pages. Ph.D. Thesis. Bioinformatics Graduate Program, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo. Environmental viruses are extremely diverse and abundant in the biosphere. Several studies have shown prokaryotic viruses (or simply phages) as major players in determining biogeochemical cycles in oceans as well as driving microbial diversification. Besides this ecological role, phages may also be used for clinical purposes since they can kill bacterial cells and terminate infections. A crucial step in this process is the isolation of new phages, which can target a specific bacterial pathogen. Thus, researchers employ screening techniques to find and isolate pathogen-specific phages from environmental samples, which are a rich source of new phages. However, this task remains mostly exploratory and laborious if the researcher has no detailed information about the sample and its potential viral diversity. Having this problem in mind, we propose the development of a bioinformatic workflow to identify genomic sequences belonging to phages in environmental datasets, as well as for host prediction of the identified phages based on their genomic sequences. To achieve this goal, we implemented a random forest classifier and created the tool named MARVEL (Metagenomic Analyses and Retrieval of Viral Elements), which is able to efficiently predict phage genomic sequences in bins generated from whole community metagenomic short reads. We also developed a toolkit, name vHULK (Viral Host Unveiling Kit), which can predict phage’s host given only their genome as input. vHULK presents higher accuracy than available tools and it can predict both host species and genus in a multiclass prediction setting. Data generated by the application of both tools in public and private composting metagenomic datasets is used for recovery, annotation, and characterization of phage diversity in composting environments. Both tools are publicly available through a GitHub repository: https://github.com/LaboratorioBioinformatica/.},

 Background: Viruses are central to microbial community structure in all environments. The ability to generate large metagenomic assemblies of mixed microbial and viral sequences provides the opportunity to tease apart complex microbiome dynamics, but these analyses are currently limited by the tools available for analyses of viral genomes and assessing their metabolic impacts on microbiomes. Design: Here we present VIBRANT, the first method to utilize a hybrid machine learning and protein similarity approach that is not reliant on sequence features for automated recovery and annotation of viruses, determination of genome quality and completeness, and characterization of viral community function from metagenomic assemblies. VIBRANT uses neural networks of protein signatures and a newly developed v-score metric that circumvents traditional boundaries to maximize identification of lytic viral genomes and integrated proviruses, including highly diverse viruses. VIBRANT highlights viral auxiliary metabolic genes and metabolic pathways, thereby serving as a user-friendly platform for evaluating viral community function. VIBRANT was trained and validated on reference virus datasets as well as microbiome and virome data. Results: VIBRANT showed superior performance in recovering higher quality viruses and concurrently reduced the false identification of non-viral genome fragments in comparison to other virus identification programs, specifically VirSorter, VirFinder and MARVEL. When applied to 120,834 metagenomically derived viral sequences representing several human and natural environments, VIBRANT recovered an average of 94% of the viruses, whereas VirFinder, VirSorter and MARVEL achieved less powerful performance, averaging 48%, 87% and 71%, respectively. Similarly, VIBRANT identified more total viral sequence and proteins when applied to real metagenomes. When compared to PHASTER, Prophage Hunter and VirSorter for the ability to extract integrated provirus regions from host scaffolds, VIBRANT performed comparably and even identified proviruses that the other programs did not. To demonstrate applications of VIBRANT, we studied viromes associated with Crohn’s Disease to show that specific viral groups, namely Enterobacteriales-like viruses, as well as putative dysbiosis associated viral proteins are more abundant compared to healthy individuals, providing a possible viral link to maintenance of diseased states. Conclusions: The ability to accurately recover viruses and explore viral impacts on microbial community metabolism will greatly advance our understanding of microbiomes, host-microbe interactions and ecosystem dynamics.},

abstract = {A metagenome contains all DNA sequences from an environmental sample, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and so on. Since viruses are of huge abundance and have caused vast mortality and morbidity to human society in history as a kind of major pathogens, detecting viruses from metagenomes plays a crucial role in analysing the viral component of samples and is the very first step for clinical diagnosis. However, detecting viral fragments directly from the metagenomes is still a tough issue because of the existence of huge number of short sequences. In this paper, a hybrid Deep lEarning model for idenTifying vIral sequences fRom mEtagenomes (DETIRE), is proposed to solve the problem. Firstly, the graph-based nucleotide sequence embedding strategy is utilized to enrich the expression of DNA sequences by training an embedding matrix. Then the spatial and sequential features are extracted by trained CNN and BiLSTM networks respectively to improve the feature expression of short sequences. Finally, the two set of features are weighted combined for the final decision. Trained by 220,000 sequences of 500bp subsampled from the Virus and Host RefSeq genomes, DETIRE identifies more short viral sequences (<1,000bp) than three latest methods, DeepVirFinder, PPR-Meta and CHEER.

 Summary
 
 The gut microbiome profoundly affects human health and disease, and their infecting viruses are likely as important, but often missed because of reference database limitations. Here, we (1) built a human Gut Virome Database (GVD) from 2,697 viral particle or microbial metagenomes from 1,986 individuals representing 16 countries, (2) assess its effectiveness, and (3) report a meta-analysis that reveals age-dependent patterns across healthy Westerners. The GVD contains 33,242 unique viral populations (approximately species-level taxa) and improves average viral detection rates over viral RefSeq and IMG/VR nearly 182-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively. GVD meta-analyses show highly personalized viromes, reveal that inter-study variability from technical artifacts is larger than any “disease” effect at the population level, and document how viral diversity changes from human infancy into senescence. Together, this compact foundational resource, these standardization guidelines, and these meta-analysis findings provide a systematic toolkit to help maximize our understanding of viral roles in health and disease.

abstract = {Despite its clinical importance, detection of highly divergent or yet unknown viruses is a major challenge. When human samples are sequenced, conventional alignments classify many assembled contigs as “unknown” since many of the sequences are not similar to known genomes. In this work, we developed ViraMiner, a deep learning-based method to identify viruses in various human biospecimens. ViraMiner contains two branches of Convolutional Neural Networks designed to detect both patterns and pattern-frequencies on raw metagenomics contigs. The training dataset included sequences obtained from 19 metagenomic experiments which were analyzed and labeled by BLAST. The model achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to other machine learning methods for viral genome classification. Using 300 bp contigs ViraMiner achieves 0.923 area under the ROC curve. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning methodology that can detect the presence of viral sequences among raw metagenomic contigs from diverse human samples. We suggest that the proposed model captures different types of information of genome composition, and can be used as a recommendation system to further investigate sequences labeled as “unknown” by conventional alignment methods. Exploring these highly-divergent viruses, in turn, can enhance our knowledge of infectious causes of diseases.},

abstract = {Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements replicating independently of the chromosome which play a vital role in the environmental adaptation of bacteria. Due to potential mobilization or conjugation capabilities, plasmids are important genetic vehicles for antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors with huge and increasing clinical implications. They are therefore subject to large genomic studies within the scientific community worldwide. As a result of rapidly improving next generation sequencing methods, the amount of sequenced bacterial genomes is constantly increasing, in turn raising the need for specialized tools to (i) extract plasmid sequences from draft assemblies, (ii) derive their origin and distribution, and (iii) further investigate their genetic repertoire. Recently, several bioinformatic methods and tools have emerged to tackle this issue; however, a combination of both high sensitivity and specificity in plasmid sequence identification is rarely achieved in a taxon-independent manner. In addition, many software tools are not appropriate for large high-throughput analyses or cannot be included into existing software pipelines due to their technical design or software implementation. In this study, we investigated differences in the replicon distributions of protein-coding genes on a large scale as a new approach to distinguish plasmid-borne from chromosome-borne contigs. We defined and computed statistical discrimination thresholds for a new metric: the replicon distribution score (RDS) which achieved an accuracy of 96.6%. The final performance was further improved by the combination of the RDS metric with heuristics exploiting several plasmid specific higher-level contig characterizations. We implemented this workflow in a new high-throughput taxon-independent bioinformatics software tool called Platon for the recruitment and characterization of plasmid-borne contigs from short-read draft assemblies. Compared to PlasFlow, Platon achieved a higher accuracy (97.5%) and more balanced predictions (F1=82.6%) tested on a broad range of bacterial taxa and better or equal performance against the targeted tools PlasmidFinder and PlaScope on sequenced E. coli isolates. Platon is available at: platon.computational.bio Data Summary Platon was developed as a Python 3 command line application for Linux.

The increasing numbers of clinical outbreaks involving resistant pathogens worldwide pushed the scientific community to increase their efforts to comprehensively investigate bacterial genomes. Due to the maturation of next-generation sequencing technologies, nowadays entire bacterial genomes including plasmids are sequenced in huge scale. To analyze draft assemblies, a mandatory first step is to separate plasmid from chromosome contigs. Recently, many bioinformatic tools have emerged to tackle this issue. Unfortunately, several tools are implemented only as interactive or web-based tools disabling them for necessary high-throughput analysis of large data sets. Other tools providing such a high-throughput implementation however often come with certain drawbacks, e.g. providing taxon-specific databases only, not providing actionable, i.e. true binary classification or achieving biased classification performances towards either sensitivity or specificity. Here, we introduce the tool Platon implementing a new replicon distribution-based approach combined with higher-level contig characterizations to address the aforementioned issues. In addition to the plasmid detection within draft assemblies, Platon provides the user with valuable information on certain higher-level contig characterizations. We show that Platon provides a balanced classification performance as well as a scalable implementation for high-throughput analyses. We therefore consider Platon to be a powerful, species-independent and flexible tool to scan large amounts of bacterial whole-genome sequencing data for their plasmid content.},

We trained the program on a dataset with 1,247 phage and 1,029 bacterial genomes, and tested it on a dataset with 335 bacterial and 177 phage genomes. We show that three simple genomic features extracted from contig sequences were sufficient to achieve a good performance in separating bacterial from phage sequences: gene density, strand shifts, and fraction of significant hits to a viral protein database. We compared the performance of MARVEL to that of VirSorter and VirFinder, two popular programs for predicting viral sequences. Our results show that all three programs have comparable specificity, but MARVEL achieves much better performance on the recall (sensitivity) measure. This means that MARVEL should be able to identify many more phage sequences in metagenomic bins than heretofore has been possible.

There are various tools that can identify viral reads in mixed metagenomic data using similarity and statistical tools. However, the lack of available genome diversity is a serious limitation to the existing techniques. In this work, we applied natural language processing approaches for document classification in analyzing metagenomic sequences. Text featurization is presented by treating DNA similar to natural language. These techniques reveal the importance of using the text feature extraction pipeline in sequence identification by transforming DNA base pairs into a set of characters with a term frequency and inverse document frequency techniques. Various machine learning classification algorithms are applied to viral identification tasks such as logistic regression and multi-layer perceptron. Moreover, we compared classical machine learning algorithms with VirFinder and VirNet, our deep attention model for viral reads identification on generated fragments of viruses and bacteria for benchmarking viral reads identification tools.

abstract = {Viruses of microbes impact all ecosystems where microbes drive key energy and substrate transformations including the oceans, humans and industrial fermenters. However, despite this recognized importance, our understanding of viral diversity and impacts remains limited by too few model systems and reference genomes. One way to fill these gaps in our knowledge of viral diversity is through the detection of viral signal in microbial genomic data. While multiple approaches have been developed and applied for the detection of prophages (viral genomes integrated in a microbial genome), new types of microbial genomic data are emerging that are more fragmented and larger scale, such as Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs) of uncultivated organisms or genomic fragments assembled from metagenomic sequencing. Here, we present VirSorter, a tool designed to detect viral signal in these different types of microbial sequence data in both a reference-dependent and reference-independent manner, leveraging probabilistic models and extensive virome data to maximize detection of novel viruses. Performance testing shows that VirSorter’s prophage prediction capability compares to that of available prophage predictors for complete genomes, but is superior in predicting viral sequences outside of a host genome (i.e., from extrachromosomal prophages, lytic infections, or partially assembled prophages). Furthermore, VirSorter outperforms existing tools for fragmented genomic and metagenomic datasets, and can identify viral signal in assembled sequence (contigs) as short as 3kb, while providing near-perfect identification (>95% Recall and 100% Precision) on contigs of at least 10kb. Because VirSorter scales to large datasets, it can also be used in “reverse” to more confidently identify viral sequence in viral metagenomes by sorting away cellular DNA whether derived from gene transfer agents, generalized transduction or contamination. Finally, VirSorter is made available through the iPlant Cyberinfrastructure that provides a web-based user interface interconnected with the required computing resources. VirSorter thus complements existing prophage prediction softwares to better leverage fragmented, SAG and metagenomic datasets in a way that will scale to modern sequencing. Given these features, VirSorter should enable the discovery of new viruses in microbial datasets, and further our understanding of uncultivated viral communities across diverse ecosystems.},

Distinguishing transmissible plasmid sequences, which are derived from conjugative or at least mobilizable plasmids, from non-transmissible plasmid sequences in the plasmidome is essential for understanding the diversity of plasmids and how they regulate the microbial community. Unfortunately, due to the highly fragmented characteristics of DNA sequences in the plasmidome, effective identification methods are lacking. In this work, we used information entropy from information theory to assess the randomness of synonymous codon usage over 4424 plasmid genomes. The results showed that for all amino acids, the choice of a synonymous codon in conjugative and mobilizable plasmids is more random than that in non-transmissible plasmids, indicating that transmissible plasmids have different sequence signatures from non-transmissible plasmids. Inspired by this phenomenon, we further developed a novel algorithm named PlasTrans. PlasTrans takes the triplet code sequences and base sequences of plasmid DNA fragments as input and uses the convolutional neural network of the deep learning technique to further extract the more complex signatures of the plasmid sequences and identify the conjugative and mobilizable DNA fragments. Tests showed that PlasTrans could achieve an AUC of as high as 84–91%, even though the fragments only contained hundreds of base pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative analysis of the difference in sequence signatures between transmissible and non-transmissible plasmids, and we developed the first tool to perform transferability annotation for DNA fragments in the plasmidome. We expect that PlasTrans will be a useful tool for researchers who analyse the properties of novel plasmids in the microbial community and horizontal gene transfer, especially the spread of resistance genes and virulence factors associated with plasmids.

HoPhage integrates two modules using a deep learning algorithm and a Markov chain model, respectively. HoPhage achieves 47.90% and 82.47% mean accuracy at the genus and phylum levels for ∼1-kb long artificial phage fragments when predicting host among 50 genera, representing 7.54–20.22% and 13.55–24.31% improvement, respectively. By testing on three real virome samples, HoPhage yields 81.11% mean accuracy at the genus level within a much broader candidate host range.

abstract = {Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, but challenges in detecting, isolating, and classifying unknown viruses have prevented exhaustive surveys of the global virome. Here we analysed over 5 Tb of metagenomic sequence data from 3,042 geographically diverse samples to assess the global distribution, phylogenetic diversity, and host specificity of viruses. We discovered over 125,000 partial DNA viral genomes, including the largest phage yet identified, and increased the number of known viral genes by 16-fold. Half of the predicted partial viral genomes were clustered into genetically distinct groups, most of which included genes unrelated to those in known viruses. Using CRISPR spacers and transfer RNA matches to link viral groups to microbial host(s), we doubled the number of microbial phyla known to be infected by viruses, and identified viruses that can infect organisms from different phyla. Analysis of viral distribution across diverse ecosystems revealed strong habitat-type specificity for the vast majority of viruses, but also identified some cosmopolitan groups. Our results highlight an extensive global viral diversity and provide detailed insight into viral habitat distribution and host–virus interactions.},

abstract = {The ecological importance of viruses is now widely recognized, yet our limited knowledge of viral sequence space and virus–host interactions precludes accurate prediction of their roles and impacts. In this study, we mined publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomic data sets to identify 12,498 high-confidence viral genomes linked to their microbial hosts. These data augment public data sets 10-fold, provide first viral sequences for 13 new bacterial phyla including ecologically abundant phyla, and help taxonomically identify 7–38% of ‘unknown’ sequence space in viromes. Genome- and network-based classification was largely consistent with accepted viral taxonomy and suggested that (i) 264 new viral genera were identified (doubling known genera) and (ii) cross-taxon genomic recombination is limited. Further analyses provided empirical data on extrachromosomal prophages and coinfection prevalences, as well as evaluation of in silico virus–host linkage predictions. Together these findings illustrate the value of mining viral signal from microbial genomes. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08490.001},

abstract = {BackgroundIdentifying viral sequences in mixed metagenomes containing both viral and host contigs is a critical first step in analyzing the viral component of samples. Current tools for distinguishing prokaryotic virus and host contigs primarily use gene-based similarity approaches. Such approaches can significantly limit results especially for short contigs that have few predicted proteins or lack proteins with similarity to previously known viruses.MethodsWe have developed VirFinder, the first k-mer frequency based, machine learning method for virus contig identification that entirely avoids gene-based similarity searches. VirFinder instead identifies viral sequences based on our empirical observation that viruses and hosts have discernibly different k-mer signatures. VirFinder’s performance in correctly identifying viral sequences was tested by training its machine learning model on sequences from host and viral genomes sequenced before 1 January 2014 and evaluating on sequences obtained after 1 January 2014.ResultsVirFinder had significantly better rates of identifying true viral contigs (true positive rates (TPRs)) than VirSorter, the current state-of-the-art gene-based virus classification tool, when evaluated with either contigs subsampled from complete genomes or assembled from a simulated human gut metagenome. For example, for contigs subsampled from complete genomes, VirFinder had 78-, 2.4-, and 1.8-fold higher TPRs than VirSorter for 1, 3, and 5 kb contigs, respectively, at the same false positive rates as VirSorter (0, 0.003, and 0.006, respectively), thus VirFinder works considerably better for small contigs than VirSorter. VirFinder furthermore identified several recently sequenced virus genomes (after 1 January 2014) that VirSorter did not and that have no nucleotide similarity to previously sequenced viruses, demonstrating VirFinder’s potential advantage in identifying novel viral sequences. Application of VirFinder to a set of human gut metagenomes from healthy and liver cirrhosis patients reveals higher viral diversity in healthy individuals than cirrhosis patients. We also identified contig bins containing crAssphage-like contigs with higher abundance in healthy patients and a putative Veillonella genus prophage associated with cirrhosis patients.ConclusionsThis innovative k-mer based tool complements gene-based approaches and will significantly improve prokaryotic viral sequence identification, especially for metagenomic-based studies of viral ecology.},

abstract = {Metagenomics has changed the face of virus discovery by enabling the accurate identification of viral genome sequences without requiring isolation of the viruses. As a result, metagenomic virus discovery leaves the first and most fundamental question about any novel virus unanswered: What host does the virus infect? The diversity of the global virosphere and the volumes of data obtained in metagenomic sequencing projects demand computational tools for virus–host prediction. We focus on bacteriophages (phages, viruses that infect bacteria), the most abundant and diverse group of viruses found in environmental metagenomes. By analyzing 820 phages with annotated hosts, we review and assess the predictive power of in silico phage–host signals. Sequence homology approaches are the most effective at identifying known phage–host pairs. Compositional and abundance-based methods contain significant signal for phage–host classification, providing opportunities for analyzing the unknowns in viral metagenomes. Together, these computational approaches further our knowledge of the interactions between phages and their hosts. Importantly, we find that all reviewed signals significantly link phages to their hosts, illustrating how current knowledge and insights about the interaction mechanisms and ecology of coevolving phages and bacteria can be exploited to predict phage–host relationships, with potential relevance for medical and industrial applications.},

abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing has greatly enhanced the discovery of viral genomic sequences; however it remains challenging to identify the host(s) of these new viruses. We developed VirHostMatcher-Net, a flexible, network-based, Markov random field framework for predicting virus-host interactions using multiple, integrated features: CRISPR sequences, sequence homology, and alignment-free similarity measures ( and WIsH). Evaluation of this method on a benchmark set of 1,075 known viruses-host pairs yielded host prediction accuracy of 62% and 85% at the genus and phylum levels, representing 12-27% and 10-18% improvement respectively over previous single-feature prediction approaches. We applied our host-prediction tool to three metagenomic virus datasets: human gut crAss-like phages, marine viruses, and viruses recovered from globally-distributed, diverse habitats. Host predictions were frequently consistent with those of previous studies, but more importantly, this new tool made many more confident predictions than previous tools, up to 6-fold more (n>60,000), greatly expanding the diversity of known virus-host interactions.},

abstract = {Metagenomes can be considered as mixtures of viral, bacterial, and other eukaryotic DNA sequences. Mining viral sequences from metagenomes could shed insight into virus–host relationships and expand viral databases. Current alignment-based methods are unsuitable for identifying viral sequences from metagenome sequences because most assembled metagenomic contigs are short and possess few or no predicted genes, and most metagenomic viral genes are dissimilar to known viral genes. In this study, I developed a Markov model-based method, VirMC, to identify viral sequences from metagenomic data. VirMC uses Markov chains to model sequence signatures and construct a scoring model using a likelihood test to distinguish viral and bacterial sequences. Compared with the other two state-of-the-art viral sequence-prediction methods, VirFinder and PPR-Meta, my proposed method outperformed VirFinder and had similar performance with PPR-Meta for short contigs with length less than 400 bp. VirMC outperformed VirFinder and PPR-Meta for identifying viral sequences in contaminated metagenomic samples with eukaryotic sequences. VirMC showed better performance in assembling viral-genome sequences from metagenomic data (based on filtering potential bacterial reads). Applying VirMC to human gut metagenomes from healthy subjects and patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D) revealed that viral contigs could help classify healthy and diseased statuses. This alignment-free method complements gene-based alignment approaches and will significantly improve the precision of viral sequence identification.},

abstract = {Abstract Plasmids are mobile genetics elements that play an important role in the environmental adaptation of microorganisms. Although plasmids are usually analyzed in cultured microorganisms, there is a need for methods that allow for the analysis of pools of plasmids (plasmidomes) in environmental samples. To that end, several molecular biology and bioinformatics methods have been developed; however, they are limited to environments with low diversity and cannot recover large plasmids. Here, we present PlasFlow, a novel tool based on genomic signatures that employs a neural network approach for identification of bacterial plasmid sequences in environmental samples. PlasFlow can recover plasmid sequences from assembled metagenomes without any prior knowledge of the taxonomical or functional composition of samples with an accuracy up to 96%. It can also recover sequences of both circular and linear plasmids and can perform initial taxonomical classification of sequences. Compared to other currently available tools, PlasFlow demonstrated significantly better performance on test datasets. Analysis of two samples from heavy metal-contaminated microbial mats revealed that plasmids may constitute an important fraction of their metagenomes and carry genes involved in heavy-metal homeostasis, proving the pivotal role of plasmids in microorganism adaptation to environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Background Viruses are central to microbial community structure in all environments. The ability to generate large metagenomic assemblies of mixed microbial and viral sequences provides the opportunity to tease apart complex microbiome dynamics, but these analyses are currently limited by the tools available for analyses of viral genomes and assessing their metabolic impacts on microbiomes. Design Here we present VIBRANT, the first method to utilize a hybrid machine learning and protein similarity approach that is not reliant on sequence features for automated recovery and annotation of viruses, determination of genome quality and completeness, and characterization of virome function from metagenomic assemblies. VIBRANT uses neural networks of protein signatures and a novel v-score metric that circumvents traditional boundaries to maximize identification of lytic viral genomes and integrated proviruses, including highly diverse viruses. VIBRANT highlights viral auxiliary metabolic genes and metabolic pathways, thereby serving as a user-friendly platform for evaluating virome function. VIBRANT was trained and validated on reference virus datasets as well as microbiome and virome data. Results VIBRANT showed superior performance in recovering higher quality viruses and concurrently reduced the false identification of non-viral genome fragments in comparison to other virus identification programs, specifically VirSorter and VirFinder. When applied to 120,834 metagenomically derived viral sequences representing several human and natural environments, VIBRANT recovered an average of 94.5% of the viruses, whereas VirFinder and VirSorter achieved less powerful performance, averaging 48.1% and 56.0%, respectively. Similarly, VIBRANT identified more total viral sequence and proteins when applied to real metagenomes. When compared to PHASTER and Prophage Hunter for the ability to extract integrated provirus regions from host scaffolds, VIBRANT performed comparably and even identified proviruses that the other programs did not. To demonstrate applications of VIBRANT, we studied viromes associated with Crohn’s Disease to show that specific viral groups, namely Enterobacteriales-like viruses, as well as putative dysbiosis associated viral proteins are more abundant compared to healthy individuals, providing a possible viral link to maintenance of diseased states. Conclusions The ability to accurately recover viruses and explore viral impacts on microbial community metabolism will greatly advance our understanding of microbiomes, host-microbe interactions and ecosystem dynamics.},
