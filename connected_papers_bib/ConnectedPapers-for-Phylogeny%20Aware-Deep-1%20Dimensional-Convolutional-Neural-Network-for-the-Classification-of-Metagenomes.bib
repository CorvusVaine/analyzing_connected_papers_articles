abstract = {This paper evaluates a novel approach to the integration of biological domain knowledge relating to the natural evolutionary structure of microbial community data to classifying 16S rDNA sequence samples. Specifically, we evaluate the use of phylogenetic trees in addition to amplicon sequence variant abundance in samples for the classification of a processed cattle metagenomics data set using machine learning. Further to this, we employ a class activation map of the network when applied to specific exemplars to determine, firstly, the relevance of higher level taxonomic data, and secondly, the most relevant taxa in determining the classification, according to the classifier.},

abstract = {“Metagenomics” is the study of genomic sequences obtained directly from environmental microbial communities with the aim to linking their structures with functional roles. The field has been aided in the unprecedented advancement through high-throughput omics data sequencing. The outcome of sequencing are biologically rich data sets. Metagenomic data consisting of microbial species which outnumber microbial samples, lead to the “curse of dimensionality” in datasets. Hence, the focus in metagenomics studies has moved towards developing efficient computational models using Machine Learning (ML), reducing the computational cost. In this paper, we comprehensively assessed various ML approaches to classifying high-dimensional human microbiota effectively into their functional phenotypes. We propose the application of embedded feature selection methods, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Penalized Logistic Regression to determine important microbial species. The resultant feature set enhanced the performance of one of the most popular state-of-the-art methods, Random Forest (RF) over metagenomic studies. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieved best results in terms of accuracy, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), and major improvement in processing time. It outperformed other feature selection methods of filters or wrappers over RF and classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and k- Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).},

abstract = {The internet surpassed the zettabyte order of magnitude of traffic in 2016. With the growth of the internet, information categorization becomes even more important than before. By matching information to existing categories, humans as well as machines are able to organize, manage, access and re-use information and knowledge resources in a more efficient and effective way. Categorization also helps to narrow the choices among content, information, and knowledge resources. Content, information, and knowledge resources can be browsed, searched, and accessed faster if they are appropriately categorized. In order to make categorization possible, a taxonomy is needed to organize content, information, and knowledge resources into a set of topical categories. In this paper, we target the need to support human computer interaction related to applying taxonomies including the challenges in taxonomy management, development, and evolution, as well as approaches to solve the related challenges. A Taxonomy Management System is introduced in this paper as a solution for supporting the human computer interaction in management, development as well as the evolution of taxonomies. The underlying architecture as well as the user interface of the Taxonomy Management System will also be explained. Finally, the implemented proof-of-concept system prototype is evaluated with real world users along real-world application use cases within the scope of a European funded Research and Innovation Action project.},

abstract = {The reduced cost of DNA sequencing allows metagenomics to be applied on a larger scale. With metagenomic analysis, we have better insight into supplement usage, methane production, and feed conversion efficiency in livestock systems. Nevertheless, sequencing machines generate an enormous amount of complex data. Conventional methods used in the analysis of genomic data involve pre-processing and synchronous reconstruction by multiple systems, which is time consuming and prone to failure. Furthermore, the sequencing datasets and analysis results need to be organized and stored properly in order for scientists to search and access them. To tackle these challenges, a new workflow for metagenomic analysis with improved infrastructure is needed. The MetaPlat project supports experts in both academic and non-academic sectors dealing with challenges in the field of metagenomics by focusing on improved hardware and software platforms. High-performance, fault-tolerant, flexible, and scalable processors and analysis systems will help to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of current metagenomics studies.

abstract = {With the rapid advancement of DNA sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics have made great progress, which deepen our understanding on the human microbiome and its impact on human health and diseases. The microbiome, which is characterized by small samples, high dimensions and complicated relationships with hosts, refers to the species, genes and genomes of the microbiota, as well as the products of the microbiota and the host environment. In fact, many machine learning methods have been used to conduct Microbiome-Wide Association Studies which can link the microbiome with the phenotypes, such as the status of human health and diseases. However, existing methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have some limitations on deep representation learning with deep architectures which can promote the reuse of features and potentially lead to progressively more abstract features at higher layers of representations. Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a kind of deep learning models, are widely used for metagenomic data analysis and can perform well on representation learning. But they are considered as a black box and sufferring from criticisms due to theirs lacking of interpretability. Thus, it is interesting to explore other deep learning models for metagenomic data analysis. In this work, we introduce a deep learning model called Deep Forest to study the microbiome associations and we also present an ensemble method for feature selection. Experimental results show that Deep Forest outperforms the traditional machine learning methods. In addition, compared to DNNs, Deep Forest has better interpretability and less hyperparameters.},

The proposed algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art classification methods for 16S rRNA metagenomic data, including Random Forests and the phylogeny-based Metaphyl algorithm, for varying sample size, classification difficulty, and dimensionality (number of OTUs), using both synthetic and real metagenomic data sets. The results demonstrate that the proposed OBC method, with either noninformative or constructed priors, is competitive or superior to the other methods. In particular, in the case where the ratio of sample size to dimensionality is small, it was observed that the proposed method can vastly outperform the others. Author summary Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between host genetics, gut microbes, and colorectal tumor initiation/progression. The characterization of microbial communities using metagenomic profiling has therefore received renewed interest. In this paper, we propose a method for classification, i.e., prediction of different outcomes, based on 16S rRNA metagenomic data. The proposed method employs a Bayesian approach, which is suitable for data sets with small ration of number of available instances to the dimensionality. Results using both synthetic and real metagenomic data show that the proposed method can outperform other state-of-the-art metagenomic classification algorithms.},

By dividing the material into many different small subsets, classification based on a taxonomy makes data exploration and retrieval faster and more accurate. Instead of having to know the exact keywords that describe the knowledge resource, users can browse and search for them by selecting the categories that the resource is most likely to belong. Nevertheless, developing taxonomies is not an easy task. It requires the authors to have a certain amount of knowledge in the domain. Furthermore, the workload will increase as any new taxonomy needs to be frequently updated to remain relevant and useful. To combat these problems, this paper proposes another approach to crowdsource taxonomy development and evolution.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing techniques have accelerated functional metagenomics studies through the generation of large volumes of omics data. The integration of these data using computational approaches is potentially useful for predicting metagenomic functions. Machine learning (ML) models can be trained using microbial features which are then used to classify microbial data into different functional classes. For example, ML analyses over the human microbiome data has been linked to the prediction of important biological states. For analysing omics data, integrating abundance count of taxonomical features with their biological relationships is important. These relationships can potentially be uncovered from the phylogenetic tree of microbial taxa. In this paper, we propose a novel integrative framework Phy-PMRFI. This framework is driven by the phylogeny-based modeling of omics data to predict metagenomic functions using important features selected by a random forest importance (RFI) strategy. The proposed framework integrates the underlying phylogenetic tree information with abundance measures of microbial species (features) by creating a novel phylogeny and abundance aware matrix structure (PAAM). Phy-PMRFI progresses by ranking the microbial features using an RFI measure. This is then used as input for microbiome classification. The resultant feature set enhances the performance of the state-of-art methods such as support vector machines. Our proposed integrative framework also outperforms the state-of-the-art pipeline of phylogenetic isometric log-ratio transform (PhILR) and MetaPhyl. Prediction accuracy of 90 % is obtained with Phy-PMRFI over human throat microbiome in comparison to other approaches of PhILR with 53% and MetaPhyl with 71% accuracy.},

abstract = {Metagenomics promises to provide new valuable insights into the role of microbiomes in eukaryotic hosts such as humans. Due to the decreasing costs for sequencing, public and private repositories for human metagenomic datasets are growing fast. Metagenomic datasets can contain terabytes of raw data, which is a challenge for data processing but also an opportunity for advanced machine learning methods like deep learning that require large datasets. However, in contrast to classical machine learning algorithms, the use of deep learning in metagenomics is still an exception. Regardless of the algorithms used, they are usually not applied to raw data but require several preprocessing steps. Performing this preprocessing and the actual analysis in an automated, reproducible, and scalable way is another challenge. This and other challenges can be addressed by adjusting known big data methods and architectures to the needs of microbiome analysis and DNA sequence processing. A conceptual architecture for the use of machine learning and big data on metagenomic data sets was recently presented and initially validated to analyze the rumen microbiome. The same architecture can be used for clinical purposes as is discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Recent human microbiome studies have revealed an essential role of the human microbiome in health and disease, opening up the possibility of building microbiome-based predictive models for individualized medicine. One unique characteristic of microbiome data is the existence of a phylogenetic tree that relates all the microbial species. It has frequently been observed that a cluster or clusters of bacteria at varying phylogenetic depths are associated with some clinical or biological outcome due to shared biological function (clustered signal). Moreover, in many cases, we observe a community-level change, where a large number of functionally interdependent species are associated with the outcome (dense signal). We thus develop “glmmTree,” a prediction method based on a generalized linear mixed model framework, for capturing clustered and dense microbiome signals. glmmTree uses the similarity between microbiomes, which is defined based on the microbiome composition and the phylogenetic tree, to predict the outcome. The effects of other predictive variables (e.g., age, sex) can be incorporated readily in the regression framework. Additional tuning parameters enable a data-adaptive approach to capture signals at different phylogenetic depth and abundance level. Simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated that “glmmTree” outperformed existing methods in the dense and clustered signal scenarios.},

abstract = {Climate change and food security are significant global challenges facing society. The dairy industry is inextricably linked to these challenges as it is concerned with the economies of food production, while acknowledging that it is a major contributor to greenhouse gas production. Action by microbial communities in the rumen is responsible for efficient breakdown of plant matter for food conversion, but a by-product of this action is substantial methane production. Insight into food conversion and methane production in rumen microbiota is possible through metagenomics analysis, which is the analysis of microbial communities and their interactions with the environment. However, metagenomic analysis is hampered by the sheer volume and complexity of data that needs to be processed. This paper presents a bioinformatics pipeline and visualisation platform that facilitates deep analysis of microbial communities, under various conditions in cattle rumen, with the aim of leading to significant impact on probiotic supplement usage, methane production and feed conversion efficiency. This pipeline was developed as part of the EU H2020 MetaPlat project and will pave the way for a more optimal usage of metagenomic datasets, thus reducing the number of animals necessary to be engaged in such studies. This will ensure better and more economic animal welfare, better use of resources and lessen the impact of the dairy industry on climate change.},

abstract = {Microorganisms are closely related to human health and have an impact on the development of various diseases. It is extremely significant to identify the relationships between microorganisms and the phenotypes (such as healthy or disease status) by analyzing microbial abundance in personalized medicine. Deep learning allows computational models that composed of multiple processing layers to learn representation of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition and object detection. However, current deep models are typically neural networks which are actually multiple layers of parameterized differentiable nonlinear models that can be trained by backpropagation. It is interesting to explore other deep learning models to handle tasks with small sample size and high dimensional data. While a unique feature of microbial data is that it has phylogenetic tree structure information which can be embedded to improve the classification performance. In this work, in order to further improve the metagenomic classification, we propose a deep model named Cascade Deep Forest which keeps the spatial structure between nodes through embedding phylogenetic tree information. Our results demonstrate: 1) the modified cascade structure can enhance the classification performance of Deep Forest; 2) embedding phylogenetic tree information can also improve the classification of the models; 3) Deep Forest achieves highly competitive performance to deep neural networks.},

abstract = {Metagenomics is an unobtrusive science of studying uncultivated microbes sampled directly from an environment, e.g. soil, ocean, air, human body, or animals, etc. Functional metagenomics particularly deals with linking microbes to environmental derivations, such as classifying the role of human gut microbiome into a diseased or non-diseased state. Ongoing research in this area includes analyzing the structure of microbial communities, and relate it to functional analysis. We present an integrative experimental framework for functional metagenomics, including data driven (abundance count of microbial species) and knowledge driven (phylogenetic tree structure) contexts. Our related experiments, indicate that i) feature selection improves the performance of classifying human microbiome samples, ii) the classification of human microbiome remains a challenging problem while incorporating phylogenetic structures. For example, our best accuracy attained on the Costello body site (CBH) dataset with forehead and external ear as body sites, is 89.13 % with a non-phylogenetic model, and 78.26 % with a phylogenetic model. This forms a potential research direction of further exploration of space for incorporating phylogeny in microbial analysis and hence developing integrative computational models for deriving functional phenotypes, based on metagenomic sequencing data.},

abstract = {The recognized significance of rumen microbiome has inspired efforts to examine the composition of rumen microbial communities in a large scale. One of the key research areas is to infer association and dependencies between members of rumen microbial communities through correlation analysis. However, it has been found that due to the compositional nature of data, simply applying correlation-based techniques to the analysis of relative abundance of microbial genes may produce artefactual correlation and loss of information. In an attempt to mitigate the compositional effect on the analysis of rumen microbiome data, this study applied a framework including a compendium of two correlation measures and three dissimilarity metrics that are intrinsically robust to compositionality. Based on the inference of significant positive and negative associations, co-presence and mutual-exclusion networks were constructed. The corresponding modules associated with methane production were identified. The modules are highly enriched with microbial genes associated with methane emissions and encoding enzymes involved in the methane methanogensis pathway. In comparisons to previous studies, our analysis demonstrates that deriving microbial associations based on the correlations between relative abundances may not only lead to missing information but also produce spurious associations.},

One potential aid in tackling such problems is the use of sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms to make face-to-state analysis and classification of emotion status so as to provide care support.

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have accelerated microbiome studies by profiling 16S rRNA genes present in microbial species. Identifying, analyzing, and targeting such microbial composition is important to provide an enriched analysis of microbial samples. In this paper, we propose a novel phylogeny and abundance aware machine learning modelling approach (PAAM-ML) for classifying microbial samples into their respective functional phenotypes. The approach integrates abundance count of microbial species as well as relationships between them, which are encoded in their phylogenetic tree of life. It incorporates the underlying structural tree information into the abundance of microbial species (features) to create a phylogeny and abundance aware matrix structure (PAAM). The matrix is then used as input for machine learning (ML) models for microbiome classification. We compared the classification performance of PAAM-ML with state-of-the-art approaches using Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio Transform (PhILR) and MetaPhyl using three use cases. PAAM-ML significantly improved the performance. It outperformed PhILR with $p$textbf$ \lt 0.01$ in Human Microbiome across 4 body sites. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of the proposed approach by applying feature engineering. Our experimental results indicate significant classification performance, for example, the highest accuracy of 0.977 and Mathews Correlation Coefficient of 0.961 was achieved when applying Random Forest and feature engineering over the PAAM associated with Human Microbiome.},

abstract = {Fueled by technological advancement, there has been a surge of human microbiome studies surveying the microbial communities associated with the human body and their links with health and disease. As a complement to the human genome, the human microbiome holds great potential for precision medicine. Efficient predictive models based on microbiome data could be potentially used in various clinical applications such as disease diagnosis, patient stratification and drug response prediction. One important characteristic of the microbial community data is the phylogenetic tree that relates all the microbial taxa based on their evolutionary history. The phylogenetic tree is an informative prior for more efficient prediction since the microbial community changes are usually not randomly distributed on the tree but tend to occur in clades at varying phylogenetic depths (clustered signal). Although community-wide changes are possible for some conditions, it is also likely that the community changes are only associated with a small subset of “marker” taxa (sparse signal). Unfortunately, predictive models of microbial community data taking into account both the sparsity and the tree structure remain under-developed. In this paper, we propose a predictive framework to exploit sparse and clustered microbiome signals using a phylogeny-regularized sparse regression model. Our approach is motivated by evolutionary theory, where a natural correlation structure among microbial taxa exists according to the phylogenetic relationship. A novel phylogeny-based smoothness penalty is proposed to smooth the coefficients of the microbial taxa with respect to the phylogenetic tree. Using simulated and real datasets, we show that our method achieves better prediction performance than competing sparse regression methods for sparse and clustered microbiome signals.},

abstract = {than SQL is the general idea of this Hadoop implementation. The advancement of technology generates growing amount of data and demands a new method to process the big data. The performance of this hadoop implementation was also compared with that of SQL to prove hadoop’s novelty in processing big data. Moreover different hadoop’s implementations – such as various number of nodes, use of a combiner, and use of different block sizes – were evaluated. Hadoop was implemented for five queries (or problems) in processing the library circulation data. Those five problems are finding the numbers of borrowing transactions categorized by the audio-video types, collection types, titles, locations, and users’ departments. Some conclusions can be drawn based on the hadoop mapreduce implementation. Hadoop’s performance tops SQL’s when large data are being processed. The more the number of computer nodes, the faster the mapreduce application is to complete its execution. Use of a combiner can speed up the application’s execution. The arrangement with full data blocks can give better execution time than that with non-full data blocks does. In this hadoop implementation, the execution time using the block size of 128 MB is smaller than that of 28 MB and 512 MB.},

Being capable of revealing the full extent of microbial gene diversity, metagenomics-based approaches hold great promises in this endeavor. This study investigates the rumen microbial community in cattle through the integration of metagenomic and network-based approaches. Based on the relative abundance of 1570 microbial genes identified in a metagenomics analysis, the co-abundance network was constructed and functional modules of microbial genes were identified. One of the main contributions of this study is to develop a random matrix theory-based approach to automatically determine the correlation threshold used to construct the co-abundance network. It has been shown that the network exhibits a highly modular structure with each of the three main modules well separated. The involvement of KEGG pathways in each module was analysed. A close look at the abundance profiles highlights that Module B is strongly associated with methane emissions while Module C is highly enriched with microbial genes associated with feed conversion efficiency.},
