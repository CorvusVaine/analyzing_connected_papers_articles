abstract = {Accurate prediction of the host phenotype from a metagenomic sample and identification of the associated microbial markers are important in understanding potential host-microbiome interactions related to disease initiation and progression. We introduce PopPhy-CNN, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) learning framework that effectively exploits phylogenetic structure in microbial taxa for host phenotype prediction. Our approach takes an input format of a 2D matrix representing the phylogenetic tree populated with the relative abundance of microbial taxa in a metagenomic sample. This conversion empowers CNNs to explore the spatial relationship of the taxonomic annotations on the tree and their quantitative characteristics in metagenomic data. We show the competitiveness of our model compared to other available methods using nine metagenomic datasets of moderate size for binary classification. With synthetic and biological datasets, we show the superior and robust performance of our model for multi-class classification. Furthermore, we design a novel scheme for feature extraction from the learned CNN models and demonstrate improved performance when the extracted features. PopPhy-CNN is a practical deep learning framework for the prediction of host phenotype with the ability of facilitating the retrieval of predictive microbial taxa.},

abstract = {The dysbiosis of human microbiome has been proven to be associated with the development of many human diseases. Metagenome sequencing emerges as a powerful tool to investigate the effects of microbiome on diseases. Identification of human gut microbiome markers associated with abnormal phenotypes may facilitate feature selection for multiclass classification. Compared with binary classifiers, multiclass classification models deploy more complex discriminative patterns. Here, we developed a pipeline to address the challenging characterization of multilabel samples. In this study, a total of 300 biomarkers were selected from the microbiome of 806 Chinese individuals (383 controls, 170 with type 2 diabetes, 130 with rheumatoid arthritis, and 123 with liver cirrhosis), and then logistic regression prediction algorithm was applied to those markers as the model intrinsic features. The estimated model produced an F1 score of 0.9142, which was better than other popular classification methods, and an average receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.9475 showed a significant correlation between these selected biomarkers from microbiome and corresponding phenotypes. The results from this study indicate that machine learning is a vital tool in data mining from microbiome in order to identify disease-related biomarkers, which may contribute to the application of microbiome-based precision medicine in the future.},

abstract = {Scientific research is shedding more and more light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human body and its role in human health. Empirical evidence shows that the microbiome is strongly interconnected with the host immune system and can contribute to carcinogenesis. Furthermore, studies show that it can be used as a predictor for various diseases. In this work, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. Adopting an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks, MVIB allows to compute a joint stochastic encoding of the input data modalities, which acts as a minimal sufficient statistics of the inputs for the prediction of a target label. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA. Additionally, we perform transfer learning experiments by fine-tuning the model on the target disease dataset after a pre-training on all other source diseases, as well as cross-study generalisation experiments. Furthermore, we adopt a saliency technique to interpret the outcome of the model classification and identify which microbial species and strain-level markers mostly contribute to a certain prediction. The combination of metabolomic data to the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles is also investigated. We show that MVIB achieves competitive results on the microbiome-based disease prediction task and is very fast to train. Author summary The gut microbiome is strongly correlated with human health and can be used to predict various diseases. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning method which allows to efficiently combine heterogeneous data modalities by computing a joint stochastic encoding. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease and we shed light on which microbial species and gene markers contribute significantly to the prediction outcome. Specifically, we analyse species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA from ten different cohorts and obtain competitive classification performance on disease prediction. Furthermore, we adopt a method based on saliency to discover which microbial species and gene markers mostly contribute to the model prediction. Additionally, we perform experiments combining abundance and marker profiles with metabolomic data extracted from mass spectrometry. We show that MVIB can operate accurate microbiome-based disease prediction and is also very fast to train.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have had unprecedented success when applied to images, waveforms, and texts to cite a few. In general, when the sample size (N) is much greater than the number of features (d), DL outperforms previous machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of convolution neural networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics ML tasks, we encounter the opposite situation where d is greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques (such as feed-forward networks) would lead to severe overfitting. Thus, sparse ML techniques (such as LASSO e.g.) usually yield the best results on these tasks. In this paper, we show how to apply CNNs on data which do not have originally an image structure (in particular on metagenomic data). Our first contribution is to show how to map metagenomic data in a meaningful way to 1D or 2D images. Based on this representation, we then apply a CNN, with the aim of predicting various diseases. The proposed approach is applied on six different datasets including in total over 1000 samples from various diseases. This approach could be a promising one for prediction tasks in the bioinformatics field.},

abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.},

Conditional generative adversarial networks train two models against each other while leveraging side information learn from a given dataset to compute larger simulated datasets that are representative of the original dataset. In our study, we used a cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease to show that not only can the generative adversarial network generate samples representative of the original data based on multiple diversity metrics, but also that training machine learning models on the synthetic samples can improve disease prediction through data augmentation.

abstract = {With the rapid advancement of DNA sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics have made great progress, which deepen our understanding on the human microbiome and its impact on human health and diseases. The microbiome, which is characterized by small samples, high dimensions and complicated relationships with hosts, refers to the species, genes and genomes of the microbiota, as well as the products of the microbiota and the host environment. In fact, many machine learning methods have been used to conduct Microbiome-Wide Association Studies which can link the microbiome with the phenotypes, such as the status of human health and diseases. However, existing methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have some limitations on deep representation learning with deep architectures which can promote the reuse of features and potentially lead to progressively more abstract features at higher layers of representations. Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a kind of deep learning models, are widely used for metagenomic data analysis and can perform well on representation learning. But they are considered as a black box and sufferring from criticisms due to theirs lacking of interpretability. Thus, it is interesting to explore other deep learning models for metagenomic data analysis. In this work, we introduce a deep learning model called Deep Forest to study the microbiome associations and we also present an ensemble method for feature selection. Experimental results show that Deep Forest outperforms the traditional machine learning methods. In addition, compared to DNNs, Deep Forest has better interpretability and less hyperparameters.},

abstract = {Abstract Motivation The human body hosts more microbial organisms than human cells. Analysis of this microbial diversity provides key insight into the role played by these microorganisms on human health. Metagenomics is the collective DNA sequencing of coexisting microbial organisms in an environmental sample or a host. This has several applications in precision medicine, agriculture, environmental science and forensics. State-of-the-art predictive models for phenotype predictions from metagenomic data rely on alignments, assembly, extensive pruning, taxonomic profiling and reference sequence databases. These processes are time consuming and they do not consider novel microbial sequences when aligned with the reference genome, limiting the potential of whole metagenomics. We formulate the problem of predicting human disease from whole-metagenomic data using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a popular supervised learning paradigm. Our proposed alignment-free approach provides higher accuracy in prediction by harnessing the capability of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within a MIL framework and provides interpretability via neural attention mechanism. Results The MIL formulation combined with the hierarchical feature extraction capability of deep-CNN provides significantly better predictive performance compared to popular existing approaches. The attention mechanism allows for the identification of groups of sequences that are likely to be correlated to diseases providing the much-needed interpretation. Our proposed approach does not rely on alignment, assembly and reference sequence databases; making it fast and scalable for large-scale metagenomic data. We evaluate our method on well-known large-scale metagenomic studies and show that our proposed approach outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods for disease prediction.

The applications of machine learning in bioinformatics include predicting of biological processes (for example, prediction tasks on gene function), prevention of diseases and personalized treatment. In the last decade, deep learning has gained an impressive success on a variety of problems such as speech recognition, image classification, and natural language processing. Among various methodological variants of deep learning networks, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been extensively studied, especially in the field of image processing. Moreover, Data visualization is considered as an indispensable technique for the exploratory data analysis and becomes a key for discoveries. In this paper, a novel approach based on visualization capabilities of Self-Organizing Maps and deep learning is proposed to not only visualize metagenomic data but also leverage advances in deep learning to improve the disease prediction. Several solutions are also introduced to reduce negative affects of overlapped points to enhance the performance. The proposed approach is evaluated on six metagenomic datasets using species abundance. The results reveal that the proposed visualization not only shows improvements in the performance but also allows to visualize biomedical signatures.},

abstract = {Background The advance of metagenomic studies provides the opportunity to identify microbial taxa that are associated to human diseases. Multiple methods exist for the association analysis. However, the results could be inconsistent, presenting challenges in interpreting the host-microbiome interactions. To address this issue, we introduce Meta-Signer, a novel Metagenomic Signature Identifier tool based on rank aggregation of features identified from multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, LASSO, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, and our recently developed Convolutional Neural Network framework (PopPhy-CNN). Meta-Signer generates ranked taxa lists by training individual machine learning models over multiple training partitions and aggregates them into a single ranked list by an optimization procedure to represent the most informative and robust microbial features. Meta-Signer can rank taxa using two input forms of the data: the relative abundances of the original taxa and taxa from the populated taxonomic trees generated from the original taxa. The latter form allows the evaluation of the association of microbial features at different taxonomic levels to the disease, which is attributed to our novel model of PopPhy-CNN. Results We evaluate Mega-Signer on five different human gut-microbiome datasets. We demonstrate that the features derived from Meta-Signer were more informative compared to those obtained from other available feature ranking methods. The highly ranked features are strongly supported by published literature. Conclusion Meta-Signer is capable of deriving a robust set of microbial features at multiple taxonomic levels for the prediction of host phenotype. Meta-Signer is user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to explore their datasets quickly and efficiently.},

abstract = {Background Diverse microbiome communities drive biogeochemical processes and evolution of animals in their ecosystems. Many microbiome projects have demonstrated the power of using metagenomics to understand the structures and factors influencing the function of the microbiomes in their environments. In order to characterize the effects from microbiome composition for human health, diseases, and even ecosystems, one must first understand the relationship of microbes and their environment in different samples. Running machine learning model with metagenomic sequencing data is encouraged for this purpose, but it is not an easy task to make an appropriate machine learning model for all diverse metagenomic datasets. Results We introduce MegaR, an R Shiny package and web application, to build an unbiased machine learning model effortlessly with interactive visual analysis. The MegaR employs taxonomic profiles from either whole metagenome sequencing or 16S rRNA sequencing data to develop machine learning models and classify the samples into two or more categories. It provides various options for model fine tuning throughout the analysis pipeline such as data processing, multiple machine learning techniques, model validation, and unknown sample prediction that can be used to achieve the highest prediction accuracy possible for any given dataset while still maintaining a user-friendly experience. Conclusions Metagenomic sample classification and phenotype prediction is important particularly when it applies to a diagnostic method for identifying and predicting microbe-related human diseases. MegaR provides various interactive visualizations for user to build an accurate machine-learning model without difficulty. Unknown sample prediction with a properly trained model using MegaR will enhance researchers to identify the sample property in a fast turnaround time.},

abstract = {Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

Lack of accurate and efficient analytical methods is an impediment for the identification of the function and presence of microbial organism within different clinical samples, reducing our ability to elucidate the microbial-host interactions and discover novel therapeutics.

In this chapter, we argue the notion of pangenome can be applied beyond the available genome sequences by leveraging metagenome-assembled genomes, to form a comprehensive representation of the genetic content of a taxonomic group in a particular environment. We present the concept of the meta-pangenome, a representation of the totality of genes belonging to a species identified in multiple metagenomic samplings of a particular habitat. As an essential component in genome-centric pangenome analyses, we emphasize the importance to perform stringent quality assessment and validation to ensure the high quality of metagenomic deconvoluted genomes. This expansion from the traditional pangenome concept to the meta-pangenome overcomes many of the biases associated with whole-genome sequencing, and addresses the in vivo ecological context to further develop a systems-level understanding of microbial ecosystems.},

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of various biosystems, ranging from the human body to the environment. A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes. Results k-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed the computationally costly Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking, and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments, and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87. For large datasets, deep learning outperformed classical methods such as Random Forest and SVM. Availability The software and datasets are available at https://llp.berkeley.edu/micropheno.},

abstract = {Motivation Accurate prediction of the host phenotype from a metgenomic sample and identification of the associated bacterial markers are important in metagenomic studies. We introduce PopPhy-CNN, a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) learning architecture that effectively exploits phylogentic structure in microbial taxa. PopPhy-CNN provides an input format of 2D matrix created by embedding the phylogenetic tree that is populated with the relative abundance of microbial taxa in a metagenomic sample. This conversion empowers CNNs to explore the spatial relationship of the taxonomic annotations on the tree and their quantitative characteristics in metagenomic data. Results PopPhy-CNN is evaluated using three metagenomic datasets of moderate size. We show the superior performance of PopPhy-CNN compared to random forest, support vector machines, LASSO and a baseline 1D-CNN model constructed with relative abundance microbial feature vectors. In addition, we design a novel scheme of feature extraction from the learned CNN models and demonstrate the improved performance when the extracted features are used to train support vector machines. Conclusion PopPhy-CNN is a novel deep learning framework for the prediction of host phenotype from metagenomic samples.

abstract = {Microorganisms are closely related to human health and have an impact on the development of various diseases. It is extremely significant to identify the relationships between microorganisms and the phenotypes (such as healthy or disease status) by analyzing microbial abundance in personalized medicine. Deep learning allows computational models that composed of multiple processing layers to learn representation of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition and object detection. However, current deep models are typically neural networks which are actually multiple layers of parameterized differentiable nonlinear models that can be trained by backpropagation. It is interesting to explore other deep learning models to handle tasks with small sample size and high dimensional data. While a unique feature of microbial data is that it has phylogenetic tree structure information which can be embedded to improve the classification performance. In this work, in order to further improve the metagenomic classification, we propose a deep model named Cascade Deep Forest which keeps the spatial structure between nodes through embedding phylogenetic tree information. Our results demonstrate: 1) the modified cascade structure can enhance the classification performance of Deep Forest; 2) embedding phylogenetic tree information can also improve the classification of the models; 3) Deep Forest achieves highly competitive performance to deep neural networks.},

abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in deep learning with neural networks, has made a profound impact on fields such as natural language processing, image classification, and language modeling; however, feasibility and potential benefits of the approaches to metagenomic data analysis has been largely under-explored. Deep learning exploits many layers of learning nonlinear feature representations, typically in an unsupervised fashion, and recent results have shown outstanding generalization performance on previously unseen data. Furthermore, some deep learning methods can also represent the structure in a data set. Consequently, deep learning and neural networks may prove to be an appropriate approach for metagenomic data. To determine whether such approaches are indeed appropriate for metagenomics, we experiment with two deep learning methods: i) a deep belief network, and ii) a recursive neural network, the latter of which provides a tree representing the structure of the data. We compare these approaches to the standard multi-layer perceptron, which has been well-established in the machine learning community as a powerful prediction algorithm, though its presence is largely missing in metagenomics literature. We find that traditional neural networks can be quite powerful classifiers on metagenomic data compared to baseline methods, such as random forests. On the other hand, while the deep learning approaches did not result in improvements to the classification accuracy, they do provide the ability to learn hierarchical representations of a data set that standard classification methods do not allow. Our goal in this effort is not to determine the best algorithm in terms accuracy-as that depends on the specific application-but rather to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of each of the approach we discuss and provide insight on how they can be improved for predictive metagenomic analysis.},

It is rare for the existing methods to consider abundance profiles from both known and unknown microbial organisms, or capture the taxonomic relationships among microbial taxa, leading to significant information loss. On the other hand, deep learning has shown unprecedented advantages in classification tasks for its feature-learning ability. However, it encounters the opposite situation in metagenome-based disease prediction since high-dimensional low-sample-size metagenomic datasets can lead to severe overfitting; and black-box model fails in providing biological explanations. To circumvent the related problems, we developed MetaDR, a comprehensive machine learning-based framework that integrates various information and deep learning to predict human diseases. Experimental results indicate that MetaDR achieves competitive prediction performance with a reduction in running time, and effectively discovers the informative features with biological insights.},

Generally, when the sample size (N) is much bigger than the number of features (d), DL often out-performs other machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics fields (including metagenomics), we encounter the opposite situation where d is significantly greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques would lead to severe over-fitting. Here we aim to improve classification of various diseases with metagenomic data through the use of CNNs. For this we proposed to represent metagenomic data as images. The proposed Met2Img approach relies on taxonomic and t-SNE embeddings to transform abundance data into " synthetic images ". We applied our approach to twelve benchmark data sets including more than 1400 metagenomic samples. Our results show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM)).

abstract = {Abstract Motivation Research supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of some diseases. Motivated by the findings that microbiome data is complex in nature, and there is an inherent correlation due to hierarchical taxonomy of microbial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), we propose a novel machine learning method incorporating a stratified approach to group OTUs into phylum clusters. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used to train within each of the clusters individually. Further, through an ensemble learning approach, features obtained from each cluster were then concatenated to improve prediction accuracy. Our two-step approach comprising stratification prior to combining multiple CNNs, aided in capturing the relationships between OTUs sharing a phylum efficiently, as compared to using a single CNN ignoring OTU correlations. Results We used simulated datasets containing 168 OTUs in 200 cases and 200 controls for model testing. Thirty-two OTUs, potentially associated with risk of disease were randomly selected and interactions between three OTUs were used to introduce non-linearity. We also implemented this novel method in two human microbiome studies: (i) Cirrhosis with 118 cases, 114 controls; (ii) type 2 diabetes (T2D) with 170 cases, 174 controls; to demonstrate the model’s effectiveness. Extensive experimentation and comparison against conventional machine learning techniques yielded encouraging results. We obtained mean AUC values of 0.88, 0.92, 0.75, showing a consistent increment (5%, 3%, 7%) in simulations, Cirrhosis and T2D data, respectively, against the next best performing method, Random Forest.

abstract = {Accurate prediction of the host phenotypes from a microbial sample and identification of the associated microbial markers are important in understanding the impact of the microbiome on the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases within the host. A deep learning tool, PopPhy-CNN, has been developed for the task of predicting host phenotypes using a convolutional neural network (CNN). By representing samples as annotated taxonomic trees and further representing these trees as matrices, PopPhy-CNN utilizes the CNN's innate ability to explore locally similar microbes on the taxonomic tree. Furthermore, PopPhy-CNN can be used to evaluate the importance of each taxon in the prediction of host status. Here, we describe the underlying methodology, architecture, and core utility of PopPhy-CNN. We also demonstrate the use of PopPhy-CNN on a microbial dataset.},

abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is prevalent in obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The present pilot study explored associations between OSA severity and metabolites in women with GDM. A total of 81 obese women with diet‐controlled GDM had OSA assessment (median gestational age [GA] 29 weeks). The metabolic profile was assayed from fasting serum samples via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC‐MS) using an untargeted approach. Metabolites were extracted and subjected to an Agilent 1,290 UPLC coupled to an Agilent 6,545 quadrupole time‐of‐flight (Q‐TOF) MS. Data were acquired using electrospray ionisation in positive and negative ion modes. The raw LC‐MS data were processed using the OpenMS toolkit to detect and quantify features, and these features were annotated using the Human Metabolite Database. The feature data were compared with OSA status, apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), body mass index (BMI) and GA using “limma” in R. Correlation analyses of the continuous covariates were performed using Kendall’s Tau test. The p values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correction. A total of 42 women (51.8%) had OSA, with a median AHI of 9.1 events/hr. There were no significant differences in metabolomics profiles between those with and without OSA. However, differential analyses modelling in GA and BMI found 12 features that significantly associated with the AHI. These features could be annotated to oestradiols, lysophospholipids, and fatty acids, with higher levels related to higher AHI. Metabolites including oestradiols and phospholipids may be involved in pathogenesis of OSA in pregnant women with GDM. A targeted approach may help elucidate our understanding of their role in OSA in this population.},

abstract = {Data visualization is still a challenge for numerous fields. For metagenomic data, datasets are usually characterized by very high-dimensional data which are hard to interpret to humans. Among diseases using metagenomic data for prediction, deep learning usually yields a lower performance comparing to classical machine learning for colorectal cancer prediction. In this paper, we present an approach using manifold learning with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and spectral embedding to visualize numerical data into images and leverage deep learning algorithms to improve the performance in colorectal cancer diseases prediction. The work also provides promising potentials to improve the visualization quality and performance in prediction tasks on dense data. The analytical results of samples coming from five various regions including America, China, Austria, Germany, and France show promising in use of combination between these visualization approaches and deep learning to enhance the performance in colorectal cancer disease diagnosis.},
