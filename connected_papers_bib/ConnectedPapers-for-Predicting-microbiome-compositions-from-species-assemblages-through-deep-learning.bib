abstract = {Microbes can form complex communities that perform critical functions in maintaining the integrity of their environment or their hosts’ well-being. Rationally managing these microbial communities requires improving our ability to predict how different species assemblages affect the final species composition of the community. However, making such a prediction remains challenging because of our limited knowledge of the diverse physical, biochemical, and ecological processes governing microbial dynamics. To overcome this challenge, here we present a deep learning framework that automatically learns the map between species assemblages and community compositions from training data only, without knowledge of any of the above processes. First, we systematically validate our framework using synthetic data generated by classical population dynamics models. Then, we apply it to experimental data of both in vitro and in vivo communities, including ocean and soil microbial communities, Drosophila melanogaster gut microbiota, and human gut and oral microbiota. In particular, we show how our framework learns to perform accurate out-of-sample predictions of complex community compositions from a small number of training samples. Our results demonstrate how deep learning can enable us to understand better and potentially manage complex microbial communities.},

abstract = {The recent recognition of the importance of the microbiome to the host’s health and well-being, has yielded efforts to develop therapies that aim to shift the microbiome from a disease-associated steady-state to a healthier one. Direct manipulation techniques of the species’ assemblage are currently available, e.g., using probiotics or narrow-spectrum antibiotics to introduce or eliminate specific taxa. However, predicting the species’ abundances at the new steady-state remains a challenge, mainly due to the difficulties of deciphering the delicate underlying network of ecological interactions or constructing a predictive model for such complex ecosystem. Here, we propose a model-free method to predict the species’ abundances at the new steady state based on their presence/absence configuration by utilizing a multi-dimensional k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) regression algorithm. By analyzing data from numeric simulations of ecological dynamics, we show that our predictions, which consider the presence/absence of all species holistically, outperform both the null model that uses the statistics of each species independently and a predictive neural network model. We analyze real metagenomic data of human-associated microbial communities and found that by relying on a small number of ‘neighboring’ samples, i.e., samples with similar species assemblage, the kNN predicts the species abundance better than the whole-cohort average. By studying both real metagenomic and simulated data, we show that the predictability of our method is tightly related to the dissimilarity-overlap relationship of the training data. Our results demonstrate how model-free methods can prove useful in predicting microbial communities and may facilitate the development of microbial-based therapies.},

abstract = {Climate change-induced phenological shifts are ubiquitous and have the potential to disrupt natural communities by changing the timing of species interactions. Shifts in first and/or mean phenological date are well documented, but recent studies indicate that shifts in synchrony (individual variation around these metrics) can be just as common. However, we know little about how both types of phenological shifts interact to affect species interactions and communities. Here, we experimentally manipulated the hatching phenologies of two competing species of larval amphibians to address this conceptual gap. Specifically, we manipulated the relative mean hatching time (early, same, or late relative to competitor) and population synchrony (high, medium, or low levels of variation around the mean) in a full 3x3 factorial design to measure independent and interactive effects of phenological mean and population phenological synchrony on competitive outcomes. Our results indicate that phenological synchrony within a population strongly influences intraspecific competition by changing the density of individuals and relative strength of early vs. late arriving individuals. Individuals from high synchrony populations competed symmetrically whereas individuals from low synchrony populations competed asymmetrically. At the community scale, shifts in population phenological synchrony interact with shifts in phenological mean to strongly affect key demographic rates (survival, biomass export, per capita mass, and emergence timing). Furthermore, changes in mean timing of species interactions altered phenological synchrony within a population at the next life stage, and phenological synchrony at one life stage altered the mean timing of the next life stage. Thus, shifts in phenological synchrony within populations can not only alter species interactions but species interactions in turn can also drive shifts in phenology.

abstract = {Significance It has been unclear whether understanding how biodiversity is maintained requires us to study species interactions within and across trophic levels simultaneously. Achieving this task remains, however, challenging for practical and theoretical reasons. Here, integrating a simple but detailed experimental plant–pollinator community and a tractable mathematical framework, we show that biodiversity is strongly affected by species competitive interactions among plants and among pollinators, as well as the mutualistic effects between pollinators on plants. Furthermore, we show that experimentally preventing some species to interact can modify the rest of the interactions and affect idiosyncratically the probability of species persistence. These effects are only observable within the empirical evaluation and not with traditional simulation approaches. Ecological theory predicts that species interactions embedded in multitrophic networks shape the opportunities for species to persist. However, the lack of experimental support of this prediction has limited our understanding of how species interactions occurring within and across trophic levels simultaneously regulate the maintenance of biodiversity. Here, we integrate a mathematical approach and detailed experiments in plant–pollinator communities to demonstrate the need to jointly account for species interactions within and across trophic levels when estimating the ability of species to persist. Within the plant trophic level, we show that the persistence probability of plant species increases when introducing the effects of plant–pollinator interactions. Across trophic levels, we show that the persistence probabilities of both plants and pollinators exhibit idiosyncratic changes when experimentally manipulating the multitrophic structure. Importantly, these idiosyncratic effects are not recovered by traditional simulations. Our work provides tractable experimental and theoretical platforms upon which it is possible to investigate the multitrophic factors affecting species persistence in ecological communities.},

abstract = {The persistence of virtually every single species depends on both the presence of other species and the heterogeneous environmental conditions. Because in natural settings many of these conditions are unknown, research has been centered on finding the fraction of possible conditions (probability) leading to species coexistence. The focus has been on the coexistence probability of two species in isolation or that of an entire multispecies system. However, it is unclear how a system can affect differently the coexistence expectation of each of its constituent pairs. Here, we derive long-term (using analytical calculations) and short-term (using simulations and experimental data) system-level indicators of the effect of multispecies systems on pairwise coexistence under unknown environmental conditions. We demonstrate that the fraction of conditions incompatible with the possible coexistence of a pair of species in isolation tends to become vanishingly small within systems of increasing numbers of species. Yet, the fraction of conditions allowing pairwise coexistence in isolation remains approximately the center of the probability distribution of pairwise coexistence across all possible systems. While the likelihood of short-term survival is always greater than or equal to that of long-term survival, we found in general stronger (resp. weaker) short-term buffering effects within systems than in isolation under negative (resp. positive) long-term effects. We show that both long-term and short-term effects of a system are not equally distributed across all of its possible pairs, but these differences can be mapped and anticipated under environmental uncertainty. Author Summary It is debated whether the frequency at which two species coexist in isolation or within a single environmental context is representative of their coexistence expectation within larger systems and across different environmental conditions. Here, using analytical calculations, simulations, and experimental data, we show how multispecies systems can provide the opportunity of pairwise coexistence regardless of whether a pair of species cannot coexist in isolation across different environmental conditions. However, we show that this opportunity is not homogeneously granted across all pairs within the same system. We provide a framework to understand and map the long-term and short-term effects that a system has on the coexistence of each of its constituent pairs. Our work can have useful applications in bio-restoration and bio-medicine subject to unknown environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The coexistence of many species within ecological communities poses a long-standing theoretical puzzle. Modern coexistence theory (MCT) and related techniques explore this phenomenon by examining the chance of a species population growing from rarity in the presence of all other species. The mean growth rate when rare, E [ r ] , is used in MCT as a metric that measures persistence properties (like invasibility or time to extinction) of a population. Here we critique this reliance on E [ r ] and show that it fails to capture the effect of temporal random abundance variations on persistence properties. The problem becomes particularly severe when an increase in the amplitude of stochastic temporal environmental variations leads to an increase in E [ r ] , since at the same time it enhances random abundance fluctuations and the two effects are inherently intertwined. In this case, the chance of invasion and the mean extinction time of a population may even go down as E [ r ] increases.},

abstract = {When do initial conditions, which reflect the assembly history of a community, affect the final community state? Comparative field studies and recent theory suggest that initial conditions matter at high productivity, because uninvasible alternate stable states and assembly cycles are more likely at high productivity. However, this prediction and the mechanisms behind it have not been tested experimentally. An alternative hypothesis is that initial conditions are relatively unimportant, and that communities generally are comprised of species with appropriate traits, which might vary with productivity. I assembled communities of protists and rotifers in laboratory microcosms from a species-rich, trophically-diverse species pool using all possible combinations of two initial conditions and four productivity levels. After communities approached their final states, invasions by the species that initially failed to persist tested the invasibility of those final states and tested for assembly cycles. I also examined how local (within-microcosm) diversity and regional diversity (total species richness of all microcosms of a given productivity level) varied with productivity. Comparative field work has used such scale-dependent diversity-productivity relationships as evidence for effects of assembly history. Productivity had a modest effect on final pre-invasion species composition, while initial conditions had a very weak effect. Most invasions failed, and the frequency of successful invasions and of post-invasion extinctions did not vary with productivity. Instead, species that were present most frequently pre-invasion were also the most successful invaders, and the least-likely species to go extinct post-invasion. Local and regional richness did not vary substantially with productivity. Overall, the results suggest that final communities are predictably comprised of species with appropriate traits, and are not an unpredictable outcome of initial conditions.},

abstract = {The timing of the first and last seasonal appearance of a species in a community typically follows a pattern that is governed by temporal factors. While it has been shown that changes in the environment are linked to phenological changes, the direction of this link appears elusive and context-dependent. Thus, finding consistent predictors of phenological events is of central importance for a better assessment of expected changes in the temporal dynamics of ecological communities. Here we introduce a measure of structural stability derived from species interaction networks as an estimator of the expected range of environmental conditions compatible with the existence of a community. We test this measure as a predictor of changes in species richness recorded on a daily basis in a high-arctic plant–pollinator community during two spring seasons. We find that our measure of structural stability is the only consistent predictor of changes in species richness among different ecological and environmental variables. Our findings suggest that measures based on the notion of structural stability can synthesize the expected variation of environmental conditions tolerated by a community, and explain more consistently the phenological changes observed in ecological communities.},

Focusing on communities, these pathways can be reflected into specific structural changes within and across trophic levels - how species interact with and affect each other - which has important consequences for species coexistence. Using the registry of the last 2000 years of plant introductions and their novel herbivores encountered in Central Europe, we find that the order of arrival of closely related (but not of distantly related) plant species constrained the structural changes within the trophic level formed by herbivore species across the observation period. Because it is difficult for field and lab experiments to be conducted over hundreds of years to record and replay the assembly history of a community, our study provides an alternative to understand how structural changes have occurred across extensive periods of time.},

abstract = {A central goal of ecological research has been to understand the limits on the maximum number of species that can coexist under given constraints. However, we know little about the assembly and disassembly processes under which a community can reach such a maximum number, or whether this number is in fact attainable in practice. This limitation is partly due to the challenge of performing experimental work and partly due to the lack of a formalism under which one can systematically study such processes. Here, we introduce a formalism based on algebraic topology and homology theory to study the space of species coexistence formed by a given pool of species. We show that this space is characterized by ubiquitous discontinuities that we call coexistence holes (that is, empty spaces surrounded by filled space). Using theoretical and experimental systems, we provide direct evidence showing that these coexistence holes do not occur arbitrarily-their diversity is constrained by the internal structure of species interactions and their frequency can be explained by the external factors acting on these systems. Our work suggests that the assembly and disassembly of ecological systems is a discontinuous process that tends to obey regularities.},

abstract = {The relative arrival time of species often affects species interactions within a community, contributing to priority effects. Recent studies on phenological shifts under climate change have generated renewed interest on priority effects, but their role in shaping long-term dynamics of seasonal communities is poorly resolved. Here we use a general stage-structure competition model to determine how different types of priority effects influence long-term coexistence of species in seasonal systems. We show that while shifts in mean and variance of relative arrival time can alter persistence and coexistence conditions of species, these effects depend on season length and type of priority effect. In “slow” systems with one or a few cohorts per season, changes in mean and seasonal variation of relative arrival time strongly altered species persistence through trait-mediated priority effects. In contrast, competition outcome in “fast” systems is largely determined by numeric priority effects due to interaction between many overlapping generations. These results suggest that empirically observed priority effects may arise from fundamentally different mechanisms, and that fast-generating systems may be less impacted by seasonal variation in phenology. Our model provides important insight into how natural communities respond to increasing variation in phenology over seasons under climate change.},

Here we show that the specific combinations of interacting species that emerge from the ecological dynamics within regional species pools are not all equally likely to be seen; rather, they are among the most likely to persist under changing environments. First, we use niche-based competition matrices and Lotka-Volterra models to demonstrate that realized combinations of interacting species are more likely to persist under random parameter perturbations than the majority of potential combinations with the same number of species that could have been formed from the regional pool. We then corroborate our theoretical results using a 10-year observational study, recording 88 plant-herbivore communities across three different forest successional stages. By inferring and validating plant-mediated communities of competing herbivore species, we find that observed combinations of herbivores have an expected probability of species persistence higher than half of all potential combinations.

Such ecosystems are often represented by a directed, signed and weighted ecological network, where nodes represent microbial taxa and edges represent ecological interactions. Inferring the underlying ecological networks of microbial communities is a necessary step towards understanding their assembly rules and predicting their dynamical response to external stimuli. However, current methods for inferring such networks require assuming a particular population dynamics model, which is typically not known a priori. Moreover, those methods require fitting longitudinal abundance data, which is not readily available, and often does not contain the variation that is necessary for reliable inference. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a new method to map the ecological networks of microbial communities using steady-state data. Our method can qualitatively infer the inter-taxa interaction types or signs (positive, negative or neutral) without assuming any particular population dynamics model. Additionally, when the population dynamics is assumed to follow the classic Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, our method can quantitatively infer the inter-taxa interaction strengths and intrinsic growth rates. We systematically validate our method using simulated data, and then apply it to four experimental datasets of microbial communities. Our method offers a novel framework to infer microbial interactions and reconstruct ecological networks, and represents a key step towards reliable modeling of complex, real-world microbial communities, such as the human gut microbiota.},

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities influence their environment by modifying the availability of compounds such as nutrients or chemical elicitors. Knowing the microbial composition of a site is therefore relevant to improving productivity or health. However, sequencing facilities are not always available, or may be prohibitively expensive in some cases. Thus, it would be desirable to computationally predict the microbial composition from more accessible, easily-measured features. Results Integrating Deep Learning techniques with microbiome data, we propose an artificial neural network architecture based on heterogeneous autoencoders to condense the long vector of microbial abundance values into a deep latent space representation. Then, we design a model to predict the deep latent space and, consequently, to predict the complete microbial composition using environmental features as input. The performance of our system is examined using the rhizosphere microbiome of Maize. We reconstruct the microbial composition (717 taxa) from the deep latent space (10 values) with high fidelity (¿0.9 Pearson correlation). We then successfully predict microbial composition from environmental variables such as plant age, temperature or precipitation (0.73 Pearson correlation, 0.42 Bray-Curtis). We extend this to predict microbiome composition under hypothetical scenarios, such as future climate change conditions. Finally, via transfer learning, we predict microbial composition in a distinct scenario with only a hundred sequences, and distinct environmental features. We propose that our deep latent space may assist microbiome-engineering strategies when technical or financial resources are limited, through predicting current or future microbiome compositions.

To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors that partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth‐density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.},

abstract = {Microbes comprise nearly half of all biomass on Earth. Almost every habitat on Earth is teeming with microbes, from hydrothermal vents to the human gastrointestinal tract. Those microbes form complex communities and play critical roles in maintaining the integrity of their environment or the well-being of their hosts. Controlling microbial communities can help us restore natural ecosystems and maintain healthy human microbiota. Yet, our ability to precisely manipulate microbial communities has been fundamentally impeded by the lack of a systematic framework to control them. Here we fill this gap by developing a control framework based on the new notion of structural accessibility. This framework allows identifying minimal sets of “driver species” through which we can achieve feasible control of the entire microbial community. We numerically validate our control framework on large microbial communities, and then we demonstrate its application for controlling the gut microbiota of gnotobiotic mice infected with Clostridium difficile and the core microbiota of the sea sponge Ircinia oros.},

abstract = {A major challenge in ecological research is to identify the tolerance of ecological communities to external perturbations. Modern coexistence theory (MCT) has been widely adopted as a framework to investigate the tolerance to perturbations in relative reductions of per capita growth rates, often using metrics that explicitly eliminate the independent role of intrinsic growth rates. More recently, the structural approach (SA) was introduced to investigate the tolerance of communities to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates as a function of the strength of intraspecific and interspecific competition. Because the external perturbations are likely to happen in both intrinsic growth rates and competition strengths, no framework alone can fully disentangle the effects of external perturbations. Here we combine MCT and SA to disentangle the tolerance in coexistence and priority effects of a pair of competing species when subject to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates and competition strengths. Through this combination, we reveal the emergence of a key trade‐off: increasing the tolerance to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates typically decreases the tolerance in competition strengths, and vice versa. Furthermore, this trade‐off is stronger under coexistence than under priority effects. We test this combined framework on competing pairs of 18 California annual plant species. For both coexistence and priority effects, we find that the tolerance to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates is maximized instead of that to perturbations in competition strengths in the studied annual plant communities. Synthesis. Our combined framework of modern coexistence theory and structural approach illustrates that it is possible to disentangle the impact of different external perturbations on the persistence of species. Importantly, our findings show that species interactions may reveal whether communities are dominated either by changes in intrinsic growth rates or by competition strengths. Overall, this combined framework can open a new perspective to understand and predict the response of populations to changing environmental conditions.},

Whether a species can invade is controlled by its invasion fitness, which depends on environmental conditions and direct interactions with resident species. But whether this invasion will cause significant transformations, such as extinctions or a regime shift, depends on a specific measure of indirect feedbacks that may involve the entire resident community. Using this metric, we investigate how the complexity, specialization and asymmetry of invader-resident and resident-resident interactions may affect the severity of invasion impacts. Our approach applies to arbitrarily complex communities, from few competing phenotypes to large nonlinear food webs, and hints at new questions to ask as part of any invasion analysis.},

Here we employ a new large-deviations (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin, WKB) approach and derive a novel and easy-to-use formula for the chance of invasion in terms of the mean growth rate and its variance. We also explain how to extract the required parameters from abundance time series. The efficacy of the formula, including its accompanying data analysis technique, is demonstrated using synthetic and empirically-calibrated time series from a few canonical models.},

abstract = {Microbes form multispecies communities that play essential roles in our environment and health. Not surprisingly, there is an increasing need for understanding if certain invader species will modify a given microbial community, producing either a desired or undesired change in the observed collection of resident species. However, the complex interactions that species can establish between each other and the diverse external factors underlying their dynamics have made constructing such understanding context-specific. Here we integrate tractable theoretical systems with tractable experimental systems to find general conditions under which non-resident species can change the collection of resident communities—game-changing species. We show that non-resident colonizers are more likely to be game-changers than transients, whereas game-changers are more likely to suppress than to promote resident species. Importantly, we find general heuristic rules for game-changers under controlled environments by integrating mutual invasibility theory with in vitro experimental systems, and general heuristic rules under changing environments by integrating structuralist theory with in vivo experimental systems. Despite the strong context-dependency of microbial communities, our work shows that under an appropriate integration of tractable theoretical and experimental systems, it is possible to unveil regularities that can then be potentially extended to understand the behavior of complex natural communities.},

While competitive exclusion is common in nature, it has remained unclear when multispecies communities formed by more than two species should be dominated by deterministic or contingent exclusion. Here, we take a fully parameterised model of an empirical competitive system between invasive annual and native perennial plant species to explain both the emergence and sources of competitive exclusion in multispecies communities. Using a structural approach to understand the range of parameters promoting deterministic and contingent exclusions, we then find heuristic theoretical support for the following three general conclusions. First, we find that the life-history of perennial species increases the probability of observing contingent exclusion by increasing their effective intrinsic growth rates. Second, we find that the probability of observing contingent exclusion increases with weaker intraspecific competition, and not with the level of hierarchical competition. Third, we find a shift from contingent exclusion to deterministic exclusion with increasing numbers of competing species. Our work provides a heuristic framework to increase our understanding about the predictability of species persistence within multispecies communities.},

Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population-dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of nonhierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence. In contrast to previous work on pairwise outcomes in largely native-dominated communities, our work supports a role for nearly neutral dynamics and priority effects as drivers of species composition in invaded communities.},

The introduction of nonlinear functional responses in two-species models has reconciled part of this compromise. However, it remains unclear whether this compromise can be extended to multispecies models. Yet, answering this question is necessary in order to differentiate whether the explanatory power of a model comes from the general form of its polynomial or from a more realistic description of multispecies systems. Here, we study the probability of feasibility (the existence of at least one positive real equilibrium) in complex models by adding higher-order interactions and nonlinear functional responses to the linear Lotka–Volterra model. We characterize complexity by the number of free-equilibrium points generated by a model, which is a function of the polynomial degree and system’s dimension. We show that the probability of generating a feasible system in a model is an increasing function of its complexity, regardless of the specific mechanism invoked. Furthermore, we find that the probability of feasibility in a model will exceed that of the linear Lotka–Volterra model when a minimum level of complexity is reached. Importantly, this minimum level is modulated by parameter restrictions, but can always be exceeded via increasing the polynomial degree or system’s dimension. Our results reveal that conclusions regarding the relevance of mechanisms embedded in complex models must be evaluated in relation to the expected explanatory power of their polynomial forms.},

Here, we develop a general method to quantify the mathematical advantage of adding higher-order interactions in ecological models based on the number of free-equilibrium points that can be engineered in a system (i.e., equilibria that can be feasible or unfeasible by tunning model parameters). We apply this method to calculate the number of free-equilibrium points in Lotka-Volterra dynamics. While it is known that Lotka-Volterra models without higher-order interactions only have one free-equilibrium point regardless of the number of parameters, we find that by adding higher-order terms this number increases exponentially with the dimension of the system. Our results suggest that while adding higher-order interactions in ecological models may be good for prediction purposes, they cannot provide additional explanatory power of ecological dynamics if model parameters are not ecologically restricted.},

The overlooked property is that stabilizing mechanisms (increasing species’ niche differences) and equalizing mechanisms (reducing species’ fitness differences) have two distinct sets of meanings within MCT: one in a two-species context and another in a general multispecies context. We demonstrate that the two-species framework is not a special case of the multispecies one, and therefore these two parallel frameworks must be studied independently. Our first result is that, using the two-species framework and mechanistic consumer-resource models, stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms exhibit complex interdependence, such that changing one will simultaneously change the other. Furthermore, the nature and direction of this simultaneous change sensitively depend on model parameters. The second result states that while MCT is often seen as bridging niche and neutral modes of coexistence by building a niche-neutrality continuum, the interdependence between stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms acts to break this continuum under almost any biologically relevant circumstance. We conclude that the complex entanglement of stabilizing and equalizing terms makes their impact on coexistence difficult to understand, but by seeing them as aggregated effects (rather than underlying causes) of coexistence, we may increase our understanding of ecological dynamics.},

Here, we propose a general formalism to obtain the set of analytical conditions of feasibility for any polynomial population dynamics model of any dimension without the need to solve for the equilibrium locations. We additionally illustrate the application of our methodology by showing how it is possible to derive mathematical relationships between model parameters, while maintaining feasibility in modified Lotka-Volterra models with functional responses and higher-order interactions (model systems with at least five equilibrium points)—a task that is impossible to do with simulations.

abstract = {Environmental change can alter species’ abundances within communities consistently; for example, increasing all abundances by the same percentage, or more idiosyncratically. Here, we show how comparing effects of temperature on species grown in isolation and when grown together helps our understanding of how ecological communities more generally respond to environmental change. In particular, we find that the shape of the feasibility domain (the parameter space of carrying capacities compatible with positive species’ abundances) helps to explain the composition of experimental microbial communities under changing environmental conditions. First, we introduce a measure to quantify the asymmetry of a community’s feasibility domain using the column vectors of the corresponding interaction matrix. These column vectors describe the effects each species has on all other species in the community (hereafter referred to as species’ multidimensional effects). We show that as the asymmetry of the feasibility domain increases the relationship between species’ abundance when grown together and when grown in isolation weakens. We then show that microbial communities experiencing different temperature environments exhibit patterns consistent with this theory. Specifically, communities at warmer temperatures show relatively more asymmetry; thus, the idiosyncrasy of responses is higher compared with that in communities at cooler temperatures. These results suggest that while species’ interactions are typically defined at the pairwise level, multispecies dynamics can be better understood by focusing on the effects of these interactions at the community level. Developing theory to explore the effects of environmental change on the structure of species interactions within communities, the authors show that enhancing asymmetry in the structure can explain idiosyncratic responses to change. They further confirm these findings on experimental data from microbial species grown together compared with in isolation, subject to different temperature regimes.},

This approach reveals a direction in which classic invasion analysis, based on initial invasion growth rate, can be extended. Indeed, we explain how the density dependence of invasion growth, if properly defined, synthetically encodes the long‐term biotic transformations caused by an invasion, and therefore predicts its ultimate outcome. This approach further clarifies how the density dependence of the invasion growth rate is as much a property of the invading population as it is one of the invaded community. Our theory applies to any stable community model, and directs us towards new questions that may enrich the toolset of invasion analysis, and suggests that indirect interactions and dynamical stability are key determinants of invasion outcomes.},

abstract = {The feasibility domain of an ecological community can be described by the set of environmental abiotic and biotic conditions under which all co-occurring and interacting species in a given site and time can have positive abundances. Mathematically, the feasibility domain corresponds to the parameter space compatible with positive (feasible) solutions at equilibrium for all the state variables in a system under a given model of population dynamics. Under specific dynamics, the existence of a feasible equilibrium is a necessary condition for species persistence regardless of whether the feasible equilibrium is dynamically stable or not. Thus, the size of the feasibility domain can also be used as an indicator of the tolerance of a community to random environmental variations. This has motivated a rich research agenda to estimate the feasibility domain of ecological communities. However, these methodologies typically assume that species interactions are static, or that input and output energy flows on each trophic level are unconstrained. Yet, this is different to how communities behave in nature. Here, we present a step-by-step quantitative guideline providing illustrative examples, computational code, and mathematical proofs to study systematically the feasibility domain of ecological communities under changes of interspecific interactions and subject to different constraints on the trophic energy flows. This guideline covers multi-trophic communities that can be formed by any type of interspecific interactions. Importantly, we show that the relative size of the feasibility domain can significantly change as a function of the biological information taken into consideration. We believe that the availability of these methods can allow us to increase our understanding about the limits at which ecological communities may no longer tolerate further environmental perturbations, and can facilitate a stronger integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

abstract = {Ecological networks—how species interactions are organized within ecological communities—are highly structured, which has motivated generations of ecologists to elucidate how these structures affect species coexistence. Unfortunately, we still do not have a clear and consistent answer about the link between network structure and species coexistence. A possible explanation is that most of the studies do not take into account that the environment affects both network structure and species coexistence due to the multidimensional and changing nature of environmental factors. In this context, the structural stability approach provides a theoretical framework grounded on biological realism to quantitatively link network structure, species coexistence, and environmental factors. I begin by an overview of the heated debates in the study of ecological networks. Then I introduce the theoretical framework and computational tools of the structural stability approach in a nutshell. Then I show the empirical applications in different ecological questions across a broad range of ecological systems. Overall, the structural stability approach provides a new perspective to understand the maintenance of biodiversity in ecological communities.},
