abstract = {Author(s): Wiest, Michael | Advisor(s): Zengler, Karsten; Cauwenberghs, Gert | Abstract: The human microbiota exhibit a highly dynamic composition over the course of life and changes in the human gut microbiota have been associated with human health or disease. Reprogramming of the gut microbiota by interventions that counter these changes and promote long-lasting health has been an emerging topic in microbiome research. Predicting changes in the gut microbiome is therefore crucial for the nature and design of these interventions. Here, we report on a new method based on deep learning to forecast changes in the microbiome. We processed and analyzed nine time-course datasets of the human gut microbiome, identifying the main microorganisms present in these microbial communities at any given time. We then used an encoder-decoder neural network to train a model that successfully predicts the progression of the microbiome composition over time given only five time points of context data. Our results demonstrate the ability to predict the fate of the human gut microbiome into the future, providing the foundation for rational intervention design.},

abstract = {Numerous diseases linked to microbial imbalance can be traced back to childhood, illustrating the impact of the juvenile microbiota development from infancy toward adulthood. However, knowledge on this subject is currently very limited. The primary aim of this study was to characterize composition and short‐ and long‐term stability of the intestinal microbiota in healthy children. Between November 2011 and June 2014, 61 children 2 to 18 yr of age from different areas in The Netherlands were included and instructed to collect fecal samples weekly, for 6 wk, and a follow‐up sample after 18 mo. The intergenic spacer profiling technique (IS‐pro) was used to analyze all available fecal samples. Microbial diversity was calculated by the Shannon diversity index and individual compositional stability by comparing all collection time points. Microbial stability varied per phylum (P < 0.0005), declined rapidly in a short time period, and subsequently stabilized on the long run with very gradual variation, leading to an overall compositional stability of 70% on average over a period of 18 mo. Higher species diversity was correlated to a higher overall compositional stability (P< 0.001). We observed an age‐independent bacterial shared core consisting of a limited number of species. In conclusion, in this study, we showed that microbial composition stability in children varied per phylum, at both short‐term and long‐term intervals. Healthy children seem to share a microbiome core consisting of a limited number of species.—De Meij, T. G. J., Budding, A. E., de Groot, E. F. J., Jansen, F. M., Kneepkens, C. M. F., Benninga, M.

abstract = {Popular naive Bayes taxonomic classifiers for amplicon sequences assume that all species in the reference database are equally likely to be observed. We demonstrate that classification accuracy degrades linearly with the degree to which that assumption is violated, and in practice it is always violated. By incorporating environment-specific taxonomic abundance information, we demonstrate a significant increase in the species-level classification accuracy across common sample types. At the species level, overall average error rates decline from 25% to 14%, which is favourably comparable to the error rates that existing classifiers achieve at the genus level (16%). Our findings indicate that for most practical purposes, the assumption that reference species are equally likely to be observed is untenable. q2-clawback provides a straightforward alternative for samples from common environments. Taxonomy classification of amplicon sequences is an important step in investigating microbial communities in microbiome analysis. Here, the authors show incorporating environment-specific taxonomic abundance information can lead to improved species-level classification accuracy across common sample types.},

abstract = {The gut microbiome is a dynamic system that changes with host development, health, behavior, diet, and microbe-microbe interactions. Prior work on gut microbial time series has largely focused on autoregressive models (e.g. Lotka-Volterra). However, we show that most of the variance in microbial time series is non-autoregressive. In addition, we show how community state-clustering is flawed when it comes to characterizing within-host dynamics and that more continuous methods are required. Most organisms exhibited stable, mean-reverting behavior suggestive of fixed carrying capacities and abundant taxa were largely shared across individuals. This mean-reverting behavior allowed us to apply sparse vector autoregression (sVAR)—a multivariate method developed for econometrics—to model the autoregressive component of gut community dynamics. We find a strong phylogenetic signal in the non-autoregressive co-variance from our sVAR model residuals, which suggests niche filtering. We show how changes in diet are also non-autoregressive and that Operational Taxonomic Units strongly correlated with dietary variables have much less of an autoregressive component to their variance, which suggests that diet is a major driver of microbial dynamics. Autoregressive variance appears to be driven by multi-day recovery from frequent facultative anaerobe blooms, which may be driven by fluctuations in luminal redox. Overall, we identify two dynamic regimes within the human gut microbiota: one likely driven by external environmental fluctuations, and the other by internal processes.},

We show that the noise term should be large and that it is a linear function of the species abundance, while the strength of the self-interactions should vary over multiple orders of magnitude. We stress the fact that all the observed stochastic properties can be obtained from a logistic model, i.e. without interactions, even the niche character of the experimental time series. Linear noise is associated with growth rate stochasticity, which is related to changes in the environment. This suggests that fluctuations in the sparsely sampled experimental time series are caused by extrinsic sources.},

abstract = {16S rRNA amplicon sequencing has enabled detailed investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the human gut microbiome and their corresponding alterations during disease. However, the contributions of temporal changes, spatial sampling location and technical sources of variability in gut microbiome studies remain poorly understood. Commonly used sequencing approaches are further limited by compositional biases due to relative abundance measurements. Here, we combine mathematical modeling with an experimental workflow based on replicate sampling and spike-in sequencing to separately quantify the major sources of gut microbiota variability measured in absolute abundances. We apply this framework to the healthy human gut microbiome and find substantial and distinct contributions to measured abundance variability associated with time, spatial sampling location and technical noise. Notably, our approach allows us to identify a critical abundance threshold (~0.01% in average taxa relative abundance) above which variability primarily results from temporal changes and below which technical noise predominates. Furthermore, we find a large contribution (~20%) to measured microbiota variability resulting from different spatial sampling locations. Across all taxa, we observe that overall patterns of temporal and spatial variability in the human gut microbiome follow closely those in other diverse ecosystems, but we also identify specific taxa whose behavior are largely associated with either underlying temporal or spatial sources. Finally, we use our approach to show that temporal factors can largely explain the significant changes in total bacterial densities observed in the gut and the abundance correlations of individual bacterial taxa. Collectively, our results highlight important pitfalls of current fecal profiling practices and provide a general framework to facilitate future quantitative ecological analysis of the human gut microbiome and other complex microbial communities.},

abstract = {The large taxonomic variability of microbial community composition is a consequence of the combination of environmental variability, mediated through ecological interactions, and stochasticity. Most of the analysis aiming to infer the biological factors determining this difference in community structure start by quantifying how much communities are similar in their composition, trough beta-diversity metrics. The central role that these metrics play in microbial ecology does not parallel with a quantitative understanding of their relationships and statistical properties. In particular, we lack a framework that reproduces the empirical statistical properties of beta-diversity metrics. Here we take a macroecological approach and introduce a model to reproduce the statistical properties of community similarity. The model is based on the statistical properties of individual communities and on a single tunable parameter, the correlation of species’ carrying capacities across communities, which sets the difference of two communities. The model reproduces quantitatively the empirical values of several commonly-used beta-diversity metrics, as well as the relationships between them. In particular, this modeling framework naturally reproduces the negative correlation between overlap and dissimilarity, which has been observed in both empirical and experimental communities and previously related to the existence of universal features of community dynamics. In this framework, such correlation naturally emerges due to the effect of random sampling. AUTHORS SUMMARY Several biological and ecological forces shape the composition of microbial communities. But also contingency and stochasticity play an important role. Comparing communities, identifying which conditions are similar in communities with similar species composition, allows to identify which forces shape their structure. Here we introduce a modeling framework which reproduces the statistical features of community similarity. We identify a single relevant parameter that captures in a single number the multidimensional nature of similarity in community composition. These results set the basis for a quantitative, and predicting, theory of the statistical properties of microbial communities.},

Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how lifestyle affects the dynamics of human-associated microbial communities.ResultsHere, we link over 10,000 longitudinal measurements of human wellness and action to the daily gut and salivary microbiota dynamics of two individuals over the course of one year. These time series show overall microbial communities to be stable for months. However, rare events in each subjects’ life rapidly and broadly impacted microbiota dynamics. Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, the dynamics of select microbial taxa could be associated with specific host behaviors. Most prominently, changes in host fiber intake positively correlated with next-day abundance changes among 15% of gut microbiota members.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that although human-associated microbial communities are generally stable, they can be quickly and profoundly altered by common human actions and experiences.},

abstract = {The colonization process of the infant gut microbiome has been called chaotic, but this view could reflect insufficient documentation of the factors affecting the microbiome. We performed a 2.5-y case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome, to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ≈500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present before the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis, and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome are associated with life events; however, additional experiments ought to be conducted to assess how different infants respond to similar life events.},

abstract = {With a diverse physiological interface to colonize, mammalian skin is the first line of defense against pathogen invasion and harbors a consortium of microbes integral in maintenance of epithelial barrier function and disease prevention. While the dynamic roles of skin bacterial residents are expansively studied, contributions of fungal constituents, the mycobiome, are largely overlooked. As a result, their influence during skin injury, such as disruption of skin integrity in burn injury and impairment of host immune defense system, is not clearly delineated. Burn patients experience a high risk of developing hard-to-treat fungal infections in comparison to other hospitalized patients. To discern the changes in the mycobiome profile and network assembly during cutaneous burn-injury, a rat scald burn model was used to survey the mycobiome in healthy (n = 30) (sham-burned) and burned (n = 24) skin over an 11-day period. The healthy skin demonstrated inter-animal heterogeneity over time, while the burned skin mycobiome transitioned toward a temporally stabile community with declining inter-animal variation starting at day 3 post-burn injury. Driven primarily by a significant increase in relative abundance of Candida, fungal species richness and abundance of the burned skin decreased, especially in days 7 and 11 post-burn. The network architecture of rat skin mycobiome displayed community reorganization toward increased network fragility and decreased stability compared to the healthy rat skin fungal network. This study provides the first account of the dynamic diversity observed in the rat skin mycobiome composition, structure, and network assembly associated with postcutaneous burn injury.},

abstract = {The recent realization that human-associated microbial communities play a crucial role in determining our health and well-being1,2 has led to the ongoing development of microbiome-based therapies3 such as fecal microbiota transplantation4,5. Thosemicrobial communities are very complex, dynamic6 and highly personalized ecosystems3,7, exhibiting a high degree of inter-individual variability in both species assemblages8 and abundance profiles9. It is not known whether the underlying ecological dynamics, which can be parameterized by growth rates, intra- and inter-species interactions in population dynamics models10, are largely host-independent (i.e. “universal”) or host-specific. If the inter-individual variability reflects host-specific dynamics due to differences in host lifestyle11, physiology12, or genetics13, then generic microbiome manipulations may have unintended consequences, rendering them ineffectual or even detrimental. Alternatively, microbial ecosystems of different subjects may follow a universal dynamics with the inter-individual variability mainly stemming from differences in the sets of colonizing species7,14. Here we developed a novel computational method to characterize human microbial dynamics. Applying this method to cross-sectional data from two large-scale metagenomic studies, the Human Microbiome Project9,15 and the Student Microbiome Project16, we found that both gut and mouth microbiomes display pronounced universal dynamics, whereas communities associated with certain skin sites are likely shaped by differences in the host environment. Interestingly, the universality of gut microbial dynamics is not observed in subjects with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection17 but is observed in the same set of subjects after fecal microbiota transplantation. These results fundamentally improve our understanding of forces and processes shaping human microbial ecosystems, paving the way to design general microbiome-based therapies18.},

abstract = {Interchanging species of similar function Under natural conditions, bacteria form mixed, interacting communities. Understanding how such communities assemble and stabilize is important in a range of contexts, from biotechnological applications to what happens in our guts. Goldford et al. sampled the microbial communities from soil and plants containing hundreds to thousands of sequence variants. The organisms were passaged after culture in low concentrations of single carbon sources and were cross-fed with each other's metabolites; then, the resulting communities were sequenced using 16S ribosomal RNA, and the outcomes were modeled mathematically. The mix of species that survived under steady conditions converged reproducibly to reflect the experimentally imposed conditions rather than the mix of species initially inoculated—although at coarse phylogenetic levels, taxonomic patterns persisted. Science, this issue p. 469 Microbial communities assemble into similar family-level compositions containing divergent genera and species. A major unresolved question in microbiome research is whether the complex taxonomic architectures observed in surveys of natural communities can be explained and predicted by fundamental, quantitative principles. Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community assembly in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the assembly of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting communities are highly predictable and governed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the assembly of large microbial communities, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.},

In order to investigate the gut microbiome structure as well as the inter-microbial associations present therein, we have performed a comprehensive global comparative profiling of the structure (composition, relative heterogeneity and diversity) and the inter-microbial networks in the gut microbiomes of 399 individuals of eight different nationalities.ResultsThe study identified certain geography-specific trends with respect to composition, intra-group heterogeneity and diversity of the gut microbiomes. Interestingly, the gut microbial association/mutual-exlusion networks were observed to exhibit several cross-geography trends. It was seen that though the composition of gut microbiomes of the American and European individuals were similar, there were distinct patterns in their microbial interaction networks. Amongst European gut-microbiomes, the co-occurrence network obtained for the Danish population was observed to be most dense. Distinct patterns were also observed within Chinese, Japanese and Indian datasets. While performing an age-wise comparison, it was observed that the microbial interactions increased with the age of individuals. Furthermore, certain bacterial groups were identified to be present only in the older age groups.ConclusionsThe trends observed in gut microbial networks could be due to the inherent differences in the diet of individuals belonging to different nationalities. For example, the higher number of microbial associations in the Danish population as compared to the Spanish population, may be attributed to the evenly distributed diet of the later. This is in line with previously reported findings which indicate an increase in functional interdependency of microbes in individuals with higher nutritional status. To summarise, the present study identifies geography and age specific patterns in the composition as well as microbial interactions in gut microbiomes.},

abstract = {Oral microbes form a complex and dynamic biofilm community, which is subjected to daily host and environmental challenges. Dysbiosis of the oral biofilm is correlated with local and distal infections and postulating a baseline for the healthy core oral microbiota provides an opportunity to examine such shifts during the onset and recurrence of disease. Here we quantified the daily, weekly, and monthly variability of the oral microbiome by sequencing the largest oral microbiota time-series to date, covering multiple oral sites in ten healthy individuals. Temporal dynamics of salivary, dental, and tongue consortia were examined by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing over 90 days, with four individuals sampled additionally 1 year later. Distinct communities were observed between dental, tongue, and salivary samples, with high levels of similarity observed between the tongue and salivary communities. Twenty-six core OTUs that classified within Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Prevotella, and Rothia genera were present in ≥95% samples and accounted for ~65% of the total sequence data. Phylogenetic diversity varied from person to person, but remained relatively stable within individuals over time compared to inter-individual variation. In contrast, the composition of rare microorganisms was highly variable over time, within most individuals. Using machine learning, an individual's oral microbial assemblage could be correctly assigned to them with 88–97% accuracy, depending on the sample site; 83% of samples taken a year after initial sampling could be confidently traced back to the source subject.Peering into the mouth: Bacterial turnover in plaque and salivaA study of bacteria in the mouth reveals insights into their diversity, stability, and variability among people and over time. By tracking daily, weekly, and monthly fluctuations of plaque and salivary bacteria in ten healthy volunteers, Dilani Senadheera at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto and co-researchers in Canada reveal significant differences in the “microbiome” present in dental, tongue and saliva samples over time. They found considerable variation in these communities between individuals, sufficient to identify a person with “bacterial fingerprints” using plaque or saliva even after 1 year. The researchers reveal a “core community” that spans different persons, oral sites, and time, suggesting some level of stability. This study is useful to understand the diversity and community drifts in different oral sites over time, which is important when plaque and saliva are used for bacterial analysis in diagnostic, risk-prediction, and forensic applications.},

abstract = {The most fundamental questions in microbial ecology concern the diversity and variability of communities. Their composition varies widely across space and time, as it is determined by a non-trivial combination of stochastic and deterministic processes. The interplay between non-linear community dynamics and environmental fluctuations determines the rich statistical structure of community variability, with both rapid temporal dynamics fluctuations and non-trivial correlations across habitats. Here we analyze long time-series of gut microbiome and compare intra- and inter-community dissimilarity. Under a macroecological framework we characterize their statistical properties. We show that most taxa have large but stationary fluctuations over time, while a minority is characterized by quick changes of average abundance which cluster in time, suggesting the presence of alternative stable states. We disentangle inter-individual variability in a major stochastic component and a deterministic one, the latter recapitulated by differences in the carrying capacities of taxa. Finally, we develop a model which includes environmental fluctuations and alternative stable states. This model quantitatively predicts the statistical properties of both intra- and inter-individual community variability, therefore summarizing variation in a unique macroecological framework.},

abstract = {Due to the recent advances in modern metagenomics sequencing methods, it becomes possible to directly analyze the microbial communities within human body. To understand how microbial communities adapt, develop, and interact over time with the human body and the surrounding environment, a critical step is the inference of interactions among different microbes directly from sequencing data. However, metagenomics data is both compositional and highly dimensional in nature. Consequently, new approaches that can accurately and robustly estimate the interactions among various microbe species are needed to analyze such data. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Microbial Time-series Prior Lasso (MTPLasso) which integrates sparse linear regression with microbial co-occurrences and associations obtained from scientific literature and cross-sectional metagenomics data. We show that MTPLasso outperforms existing models in terms of precision and recall rates, as well as the accuracy in inferring the interaction types. Finally, the interaction networks we infer from human gut data demonstrate credible results when compared against real data.},

abstract = {To what extent do host genetics control the composition of the gut microbiome? Studies comparing the gut microbiota in human twins and across inbred mouse lines have yielded inconsistent answers to this question. However, candidate gene approaches, in which one gene is deleted or added to a model host organism, show that a single host gene can have a tremendous effect on the diversity and population structure of the gut microbiota. Now, quantitative genetics is emerging as a highly promising approach that can be used to better understand the overall architecture of host genetic influence on the microbiota, and to discover additional host genes controlling microbial diversity in the gut. In this Review, we describe how host genetics and the environment shape the microbiota, and how these three factors may interact in the context of chronic disease.},

abstract = {The human gut microbiome is the subject of intense study due to its importance in health and disease. The majority of these studies have been based on the analysis of feces. However, little is known about how the microbial composition in fecal samples relates to the spatial distribution of microbial taxa along the gastrointestinal tract. By characterizing the microbial content both in intestinal tissue samples and in fecal samples obtained daily, we provide a conceptual framework for how the spatial structure relates to biotic interactions on the community level. We further describe general categories of spatial distribution patterns and identify taxa conforming to these categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study combining spatial and temporal analyses of the human gut microbiome. This type of analysis can be used for identifying candidate probiotics and designing strategies for clinical intervention. ABSTRACT The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is a densely populated ecosystem where dynamics are determined by interactions between microbial community members, as well as host factors. The spatial organization of this system is thought to be important in human health, yet this aspect of our resident microbiome is still poorly understood. In this study, we report significant spatial structure of the GI microbiota, and we identify general categories of spatial patterning in the distribution of microbial taxa along a healthy human GI tract. We further estimate the biotic interaction structure in the GI microbiota, both through time series and cooccurrence modeling of microbial community data derived from a large number of sequentially collected fecal samples. Comparison of these two approaches showed that species pairs involved in significant negative interactions had strong positive contemporaneous correlations and vice versa, while for species pairs without significant interactions, contemporaneous correlations were distributed around zero. We observed similar patterns when comparing these models to the spatial correlations between taxa identified in the adherent microbiota. This suggests that colocalization of microbial taxon pairs, and thus the spatial organization of the GI microbiota, is driven, at least in part, by direct or indirect biotic interactions. Thus, our study can provide a basis for an ecological interpretation of the biogeography of the human gut.

abstract = {Across diverse microbiotas, species abundances vary in time with distinctive statistical behaviors that appear to generalize across hosts, but the origins and implications of these patterns remain unclear. Here, we show that many of these patterns can be quantitatively recapitulated by a simple class of resource-competition models, in which the metabolic capabilities of different species are randomly drawn from a common statistical ensemble. Our coarse-grained model parametrizes the intrinsic consumer-resource properties of a community using a small number of macroscopic parameters, including the total number of resources, typical resource fluctuations over time, and the average overlap in resource-consumption profiles across species. We elucidate how variation in these parameters affects various time series statistics, enabling macroscopic parameter estimation and comparison across wide-ranging microbiotas, including the human gut, saliva, and vagina, as well as mouse gut and rice. The successful recapitulation of time series statistics across microbiotas suggests that resource competition generally acts as a dominant driver of community dynamics. Our work unifies numerous time series patterns under one model, clarifies their origins, and provides a framework to infer macroscopic parameters of resource competition from longitudinal studies of microbial communities.},

abstract = {The issue of what factors shape the gut microbiota has been studied for years. However, questions on the contribution of host genetics to the colonizing process of the gut microbiota and to the extent that host genetics affect the gut microbiota have not yet been clearly answered. Most recently published reports have concluded that host genetics make a smaller contribution than other factors, such as diet, in determining the gut microbiota. Here we have exploited the increasing amount of fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing data that are becoming available to conduct an analysis to assess the influence of host genetics on the diversity of the gut microbiota. By re-analyzing data obtained from over 5000 stool samples, representing individuals living on five continents and ranging in age from 3 days to 87 years, we found that the strength of the various factors affecting the membership or structure of the gut microbiota are quite different, which leads us to a hypothesis that the presence or absence of taxa is largely controlled by host genetics, whereas non-genetic factors regulate the abundance of each taxon. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the genome similarity positively correlates with the similarity of community membership. Finally, we showed that only severe perturbations are able to alter the gut microbial community membership. In summary, our work provides new insights into understanding the complexities of the gut microbial community and how it responds to changes imposed on it.},

Coexistence is a puzzle because we lack a mechanistic understanding of the variation in species presence and abundance. Whether variation in ecological communities is driven by deterministic or random processes is one of the most controversial issues in ecology. Here, I study the variation of species presence and abundance in microbial communities from a macroecological standpoint. I identify three macroecological laws that quantitatively characterize the fluctuation of species abundance across communities and over time. Using these three laws, one can predict species’ presence and absence, diversity, and commonly studied macroecological patterns. I show that a mathematical model based on environmental stochasticity, the stochastic logistic model, quantitatively predicts the three macroecological laws, as well as non-stationary properties of community dynamics.},

abstract = {The human gut can be viewed as a flow-through system with a short residence time, a high turnover rate and a spatial gradient of physiological conditions. As a consequence, the gut microbiota is exposed to highly fluctuating environmental determinants presented by the host and diet. Here, we assessed the fermentation and colonisation of insoluble wheat bran by faecal microbiota of three individuals at an unprecedented sampling intensity. Time-resolved 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, revealed a dynamic microbial community, characterised by abrupt shifts in composition, delimiting states with a more constant community, giving rise to a succession of bacterial taxa alternately dominating the community over a 72 h timespan. Early stages were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Fusobacterium species, growing on the carbohydrate-low, protein rich medium to which wheat bran was supplemented. The onset of wheat bran fermentation, marked by a spike in short chain fatty acid production with an increasing butyrate proportion and an increased endo-1,4-β-xylanase activity, corresponded to donor-dependent proportional increases of Bacteroides ovatus / stercoris , Prevotella copri and Firmicutes species, which were strongly enriched in the bran-attached community. Literature and database searches provided novel insights into the metabolic and growth characteristics underlying the observed succession and colonisation, illustrating the potency of a time-resolved analysis to increase our understanding of gut microbiota dynamics upon dietary modulations.},

Comparing populations we find that community structure is significantly more similar between datasets than expected by chance. Mapping communities across the datasets, we also show that communities can have similar associations to host phenotypes in different populations.

abstract = {BackgroundSeveral studies have focused on the microbiota living in environmental niches including human body sites. In many of these studies, researchers collect longitudinal data with the goal of understanding not only just the composition of the microbiome but also the interactions between the different taxa. However, analysis of such data is challenging and very few methods have been developed to reconstruct dynamic models from time series microbiome data.ResultsHere, we present a computational pipeline that enables the integration of data across individuals for the reconstruction of such models. Our pipeline starts by aligning the data collected for all individuals. The aligned profiles are then used to learn a dynamic Bayesian network which represents causal relationships between taxa and clinical variables. Testing our methods on three longitudinal microbiome data sets we show that our pipeline improve upon prior methods developed for this task. We also discuss the biological insights provided by the models which include several known and novel interactions.

The source code and documentation can be downloaded from https://github.com/jlugomar/longitudinal_microbiome_analysis_public.ConclusionsWe propose a computational pipeline for analyzing longitudinal microbiome data. Our results provide evidence that microbiome alignments coupled with dynamic Bayesian networks improve predictive performance over previous methods and enhance our ability to infer biological relationships within the microbiome and between taxa and clinical factors.},

abstract = {Due to the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, it becomes possible to directly analyze microbial communities in the human body and in the environment. Knowledge of how microbes interact with each other and form functional communities can provide a solid foundation to understand microbiome related diseases; this can serve as a key step towards precision medicine. In order to understand how microbes form communities, we propose a two step approach: First, we infer the microbial co-occurrence network by integrating a graph inference algorithm with phylogenetic information obtained directly from metagenomic data. Next, we utilize a network-based community detection algorithm to cluster microbes into functional groups where microbes in each group are highly correlated. We also curate a "gold standard" network based on the microbe-metabolic relationships which are extracted directly from the metagenomic data. Utilizing community detection on the resulting microbial metabolic pathway bipartite graph, the community membership for each microbe can be viewed as the true label when evaluating against other existing methods. Overall, our proposed framework Phylogenetic Graphical Lasso (PGLasso) outperforms existing methods with gains larger than 100% in terms of Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) which is commonly used to quantify the goodness of clusterings.},

abstract = {Almost immediately after a human being is born, so too is a new microbial ecosystem, one that resides in that person's gastrointestinal tract. Although it is a universal and integral part of human biology, the temporal progression of this process, the sources of the microbes that make up the ecosystem, how and why it varies from one infant to another, and how the composition of this ecosystem influences human physiology, development, and disease are still poorly understood. As a step toward systematically investigating these questions, we designed a microarray to detect and quantitate the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences of most currently recognized species and taxonomic groups of bacteria. We used this microarray, along with sequencing of cloned libraries of PCR-amplified SSU rDNA, to profile the microbial communities in an average of 26 stool samples each from 14 healthy, full-term human infants, including a pair of dizygotic twins, beginning with the first stool after birth and continuing at defined intervals throughout the first year of life. To investigate possible origins of the infant microbiota, we also profiled vaginal and milk samples from most of the mothers, and stool samples from all of the mothers, most of the fathers, and two siblings. The composition and temporal patterns of the microbial communities varied widely from baby to baby. Despite considerable temporal variation, the distinct features of each baby's microbial community were recognizable for intervals of weeks to months. The strikingly parallel temporal patterns of the twins suggested that incidental environmental exposures play a major role in determining the distinctive characteristics of the microbial community in each baby. By the end of the first year of life, the idiosyncratic microbial ecosystems in each baby, although still distinct, had converged toward a profile characteristic of the adult gastrointestinal tract.},

abstract = {Upon delivery, the neonate is exposed for the first time to a wide array of microbes from a variety of sources, including maternal bacteria. Although prior studies have suggested that delivery mode shapes the microbiota's establishment and, subsequently, its role in child health, most researchers have focused on specific bacterial taxa or on a single body habitat, the gut. Thus, the initiation stage of human microbiome development remains obscure. The goal of the present study was to obtain a community-wide perspective on the influence of delivery mode and body habitat on the neonate's first microbiota. We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities from mothers and their newborn babies, four born vaginally and six born via Cesarean section. Mothers’ skin, oral mucosa, and vagina were sampled 1 h before delivery, and neonates’ skin, oral mucosa, and nasopharyngeal aspirate were sampled <5 min, and meconium <24 h, after delivery. We found that in direct contrast to the highly differentiated communities of their mothers, neonates harbored bacterial communities that were undifferentiated across multiple body habitats, regardless of delivery mode. Our results also show that vaginally delivered infants acquired bacterial communities resembling their own mother's vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and C-section infants harbored bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface, dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. These findings establish an important baseline for studies tracking the human microbiome's successional development in different body habitats following different delivery modes, and their associated effects on infant health.},

abstract = {The human distal gut harbours a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides. Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person’s gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable ‘core microbiome’ at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).},

abstract = {Many of the immune and metabolic changes occurring during normal pregnancy also describe metabolic syndrome. Gut microbiota can cause symptoms of metabolic syndrome in nonpregnant hosts. Here, to explore their role in pregnancy, we characterized fecal bacteria of 91 pregnant women of varying prepregnancy BMIs and gestational diabetes status and their infants. Similarities between infant-mother microbiotas increased with children's age, and the infant microbiota was unaffected by mother's health status. Gut microbiota changed dramatically from first (T1) to third (T3) trimesters, with vast expansion of diversity between mothers, an overall increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and reduced richness. T3 stool showed strongest signs of inflammation and energy loss; however, microbiome gene repertoires were constant between trimesters. When transferred to germ-free mice, T3 microbiota induced greater adiposity and insulin insensitivity compared to T1. Our findings indicate that host-microbial interactions that impact host metabolism can occur and may be beneficial in pregnancy.},
