abstract = {Environmental surveillance is a critical tool for combatting public health threats represented by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the continuous increase of antibiotic resistance in pathogens. With its power to detect entire microbial communities, metagenomics-based methods stand out in addressing the need. However, several hurdles remain to be overcome in order to generate actionable interpretations from metagenomic sequencing data for infection prevention. Conceptually and technically, we focus on viability assessment, taxonomic resolution, and quantitative metagenomics, and discuss their current advancements, necessary precautions and directions to further development. We highlight the importance of building solid conceptual frameworks and identifying rational limits to facilitate the application of techniques. We also propose the usage of internal standards as a promising approach to overcome analytical bottlenecks introduced by low biomass samples and the inherent lack of quantitation in metagenomics. Taken together, we hope this perspective will contribute to bringing accurate and consistent metagenomics-based environmental surveillance to the ground.},

abstract = {Scientific research is shedding more and more light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human body and its role in human health. Empirical evidence shows that the microbiome is strongly interconnected with the host immune system and can contribute to carcinogenesis. Furthermore, studies show that it can be used as a predictor for various diseases. In this work, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel machine learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. Adopting an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks, MVIB allows to compute a joint stochastic encoding of the input data modalities, which acts as a minimal sufficient statistics of the inputs for the prediction of a target label. We use the MVIB to predict whether patients are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA. Additionally, we perform transfer learning experiments by fine-tuning the model on the target disease dataset after a pre-training on all other source diseases, as well as cross-study generalisation experiments. Furthermore, we adopt a saliency technique to interpret the outcome of the model classification and identify which microbial species and strain-level markers mostly contribute to a certain prediction. The combination of metabolomic data to the species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles is also investigated. We show that MVIB achieves competitive results on the microbiome-based disease prediction task and is very fast to train. Author summary The gut microbiome is strongly correlated with human health and can be used to predict various diseases.

Specifically, we analyse species-relative abundance and strain-level marker profiles extracted from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA from ten different cohorts and obtain competitive classification performance on disease prediction. Furthermore, we adopt a method based on saliency to discover which microbial species and gene markers mostly contribute to the model prediction. Additionally, we perform experiments combining abundance and marker profiles with metabolomic data extracted from mass spectrometry.

Here, we utilize 5643 aggregated, annotated whole-community metagenomes from 19 different diseases to implement the first multiclass microbiome disease classifier of this scale. We compared three different machine learning models: random forests, deep neural nets, and a novel graph convolutional architecture which exploits the graph structure of phylogenetic trees as its input. We show that the graph convolutional model outperforms deep neural nets in terms of accuracy (achieving 75% average test-set accuracy), receiver-operator-characteristics (92.1% average AUC), and precision-recall (50% average AUPR). Additionally, the convolutional net’s performance complements that of the random forest, achieving similar accuracy but better receiver-operator-characteristics and lower area under precision-recall. Lastly, we are able to achieve over 90% average top-3 accuracy across all of our models. Together, these results indicate that there are predictive, disease specific signatures across microbiomes which could potentially be used for diagnostic purposes.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have had unprecedented success when applied to images, waveforms, and texts to cite a few. In general, when the sample size (N) is much greater than the number of features (d), DL outperforms previous machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of convolution neural networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics ML tasks, we encounter the opposite situation where d is greater than N. In these situations, applying DL techniques (such as feed-forward networks) would lead to severe overfitting. Thus, sparse ML techniques (such as LASSO e.g.) usually yield the best results on these tasks. In this paper, we show how to apply CNNs on data which do not have originally an image structure (in particular on metagenomic data). Our first contribution is to show how to map metagenomic data in a meaningful way to 1D or 2D images. Based on this representation, we then apply a CNN, with the aim of predicting various diseases. The proposed approach is applied on six different datasets including in total over 1000 samples from various diseases. This approach could be a promising one for prediction tasks in the bioinformatics field.},

abstract = {Motivation Accurate prediction of the host phenotype from a metgenomic sample and identification of the associated bacterial markers are important in metagenomic studies. We introduce PopPhy-CNN, a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) learning architecture that effectively exploits phylogentic structure in microbial taxa. PopPhy-CNN provides an input format of 2D matrix created by embedding the phylogenetic tree that is populated with the relative abundance of microbial taxa in a metagenomic sample. This conversion empowers CNNs to explore the spatial relationship of the taxonomic annotations on the tree and their quantitative characteristics in metagenomic data. Results PopPhy-CNN is evaluated using three metagenomic datasets of moderate size. We show the superior performance of PopPhy-CNN compared to random forest, support vector machines, LASSO and a baseline 1D-CNN model constructed with relative abundance microbial feature vectors. In addition, we design a novel scheme of feature extraction from the learned CNN models and demonstrate the improved performance when the extracted features are used to train support vector machines. Conclusion PopPhy-CNN is a novel deep learning framework for the prediction of host phenotype from metagenomic samples. PopPhy-CNN can efficiently train models and does not require excessive amount of data. PopPhy-CNN facilities not only retrieval of informative microbial taxa from the trained CNN models but also visualization of the taxa on the phynogenetic tree.

abstract = {Analysis of the human microbiome using metagenomic sequencing data has demonstrated high ability in discriminating various human diseases. Raw metagenomic sequencing data require multiple complex and computationally heavy bioinformatics steps prior to data analysis. Such data contain millions of short sequences read from the fragmented DNA sequences and are stored as fastq files. Conventional processing pipelines consist multiple steps including quality control, filtering, alignment of sequences against genomic catalogs (genes, species, taxonomic levels, functional pathways, etc.). These pipelines are complex to use, time consuming and rely on a large number of parameters that often provide variability and impact the estimation of the microbiome elements. Recent studies have demonstrated that training Deep Neural Networks directly from raw sequencing data is a promising approach to bypass some of the challenges associated with mainstream bioinformatics pipelines. Most of these methods use the concept of word and sentence embeddings that create a meaningful and numerical representation of DNA sequences, while extracting features and reducing the dimentionality of the data. In this paper we present an end-to-end approach that classifies patients into disease groups directly from raw metagenomic reads: metagenome2vec. This approach is composed of four steps (i) generating a vocabulary of k-mers and learning their numerical embeddings; (ii) learning DNA sequence (read) embeddings; (iii) identifying the genome from which the sequence is most likely to come and (iv) training a multiple instance learning classifier which predicts the phenotype based on the vector representation of the raw data. An attention mechanism is applied in the network so that the model can be interpreted, assigning a weight to the influence of the prediction for each genome. Using two public real-life datasets as well a simulated one, we demonstrated that this original approach reached very high performances, comparable with the state-of-the-art methods applied directly on processed data though mainstream bioinformatics workflows. These results are encouraging for this proof of concept work. We believe that with further dedication, the DNN models have the potential to surpass mainstream bioinformatics workflows in disease classification tasks.},

abstract = {The composition of the gut microbiome associates with a wide range of human diseases, but the mechanisms underpinning these associations are not well understood. To shift toward a mechanistic understanding, we integrated distinct metagenomic data sets to identify functions encoded in the gut microbiome that associate with multiple diseases, which may be important to human health. Additionally, we identified functions that associate with specific diseases, which may elucidate disease-specific etiologies. We demonstrated that the functions encoded in the microbiome can be used to classify disease status, but the inclusion of additional patient covariates may be necessary to obtain sufficient accuracy. Ultimately, this analysis advances our understanding of the gut microbiome functions that constitute a healthy microbiome and identifies potential targets for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics. ABSTRACT While recent research indicates that human health is affected by the gut microbiome, the functional mechanisms that underlie host-microbiome interactions remain poorly resolved. Metagenomic clinical studies can address this problem by revealing specific microbial functions that stratify healthy and diseased individuals. To improve our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and health, we conducted the first integrative functional analysis of nearly 2,000 publicly available fecal metagenomic samples obtained from eight clinical studies. We identified characteristics of the gut microbiome that associate generally with disease, including functional alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and beta-dispersion. Using regression modeling, we identified specific microbial functions that robustly stratify diseased individuals from healthy controls. Many of these functions overlapped multiple diseases, suggesting a general role in host health, while others were specific to a single disease and may indicate disease-specific etiologies. Our results clarify potential microbiome-mediated mechanisms of disease and reveal features of the microbiome that may be useful for the development of microbiome-based diagnostics.

It is rare for the existing methods to consider abundance profiles from both known and unknown microbial organisms, or capture the taxonomic relationships among microbial taxa, leading to significant information loss. On the other hand, deep learning has shown unprecedented advantages in classification tasks for its feature-learning ability. However, it encounters the opposite situation in metagenome-based disease prediction since high-dimensional low-sample-size metagenomic datasets can lead to severe overfitting; and black-box model fails in providing biological explanations. To circumvent the related problems, we developed MetaDR, a comprehensive machine learning-based framework that integrates various information and deep learning to predict human diseases. Experimental results indicate that MetaDR achieves competitive prediction performance with a reduction in running time, and effectively discovers the informative features with biological insights.},

abstract = {Abstract Motivation The human body hosts more microbial organisms than human cells. Analysis of this microbial diversity provides key insight into the role played by these microorganisms on human health. Metagenomics is the collective DNA sequencing of coexisting microbial organisms in an environmental sample or a host. This has several applications in precision medicine, agriculture, environmental science and forensics. State-of-the-art predictive models for phenotype predictions from metagenomic data rely on alignments, assembly, extensive pruning, taxonomic profiling and reference sequence databases. These processes are time consuming and they do not consider novel microbial sequences when aligned with the reference genome, limiting the potential of whole metagenomics. We formulate the problem of predicting human disease from whole-metagenomic data using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a popular supervised learning paradigm. Our proposed alignment-free approach provides higher accuracy in prediction by harnessing the capability of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within a MIL framework and provides interpretability via neural attention mechanism. Results The MIL formulation combined with the hierarchical feature extraction capability of deep-CNN provides significantly better predictive performance compared to popular existing approaches. The attention mechanism allows for the identification of groups of sequences that are likely to be correlated to diseases providing the much-needed interpretation. Our proposed approach does not rely on alignment, assembly and reference sequence databases; making it fast and scalable for large-scale metagenomic data. We evaluate our method on well-known large-scale metagenomic studies and show that our proposed approach outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods for disease prediction.

In order to characterize the effects from microbiome composition for human health, diseases, and even ecosystems, one must first understand the relationship of microbes and their environment in different samples. Running machine learning model with metagenomic sequencing data is encouraged for this purpose, but it is not an easy task to make an appropriate machine learning model for all diverse metagenomic datasets. Results We introduce MegaR, an R Shiny package and web application, to build an unbiased machine learning model effortlessly with interactive visual analysis. The MegaR employs taxonomic profiles from either whole metagenome sequencing or 16S rRNA sequencing data to develop machine learning models and classify the samples into two or more categories. It provides various options for model fine tuning throughout the analysis pipeline such as data processing, multiple machine learning techniques, model validation, and unknown sample prediction that can be used to achieve the highest prediction accuracy possible for any given dataset while still maintaining a user-friendly experience. Conclusions Metagenomic sample classification and phenotype prediction is important particularly when it applies to a diagnostic method for identifying and predicting microbe-related human diseases. MegaR provides various interactive visualizations for user to build an accurate machine-learning model without difficulty. Unknown sample prediction with a properly trained model using MegaR will enhance researchers to identify the sample property in a fast turnaround time.},

abstract = {Advancements in machine learning in general and in deep learning in particular have achieved great success in numerous fields. For personalized medicine approaches, frameworks derived from learning algorithms play an important role in supporting scientists to investigate and explore novel data sources such as metagenomic data to develop and examine methodologies to improve human healthcare. Some challenges when processing this data type include its very high dimensionality and the complexity of diseases. Metagenomic data that include gene families often have millions of features. This leads to a further increase of complexity in processing and requires a huge amount of time for computation. In this study, we propose a method combining feature selection using perceptron weight-based filters and synthetic image generation to leverage deep-learning advancements in order to predict various diseases based on gene family abundance data. An experiment was conducted using gene family datasets of five diseases, i.e. liver cirrhosis, obesity, inflammatory bowel diseases, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. The proposed method provides not only visualization for gene family abundance data but also achieved a promising performance level.},

While more complex sequential or convolutional networks potentially yield superior classification performance, the improvements in classification accuracy are typically mediocre compared to the simple vector averaging. As an efficient alternative, we propose the use of discrete cosine transform (DCT) to compress word sequences in an order-preserving manner. The lower order DCT coefficients represent the overall feature patterns in sentences, which results in suitable embeddings for tasks that could benefit from syntactic features. Our results in semantic probing tasks demonstrate that DCT embeddings indeed preserve more syntactic information compared with vector averaging. With practically equivalent complexity, the model yields better overall performance in downstream classification tasks that correlate with syntactic features, which illustrates the capacity of DCT to preserve word order information.},

SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as the seventh coronavirus affecting Homo sapiens. The symptoms of COVID-19 consist of an elevated temperature, cough, diarrhea, and vomiting amongst others, whereas the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to arise via release of respiratory secretions; through sneezing and coughing. COVID-19 is identified via X-ray or computed tomography scans and further corroborated with molecular diagnostics techniques, including polymerase chain reaction. At present there are no successful therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2; existing antiviral therapies have been utilized to hinder manifestation of respiratory difficulties by diminishing viral load. Herein, we depict an extensive update on the clinical aspects of COVID-19, including strategies for the regulation of the transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.},

abstract = {The major problem when analyzing a metagenomic sample is to taxonomically annotate its reads to identify the species they contain. Most of the methods currently available focus on the classification of reads using a set of reference genomes and their k-mers. While in terms of precision these methods have reached percentages of correctness close to perfection, in terms of recall (the actual number of classified reads) the performances fall at around 50%. One of the reasons is the fact that the sequences in a sample can be very different from the corresponding reference genome, e.g., viral genomes are highly mutated. To address this issue, in this paper we study the problem of metagenomic reads classification by improving the reference k-mers library with novel discriminative k-mers from the input sequencing reads. We evaluated the performance in different conditions against several other tools and the results showed an improved F-measure, especially when close reference genomes are not available.

Given the fact that word embeddings can capture semantic relationship while semantically similar words tend to form semantic groups in a high-dimensional embedding space, we develop a sentence representation scheme by analyzing semantic subspaces of its constituent words. Specifically, we construct a sentence model from two aspects. First, we represent words that lie in the same semantic group using the intra-group descriptor. Second, we characterize the interaction between multiple semantic groups with the inter-group descriptor. The proposed S3E method is evaluated on both textual similarity tasks and supervised tasks. Experimental results show that it offers comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art. The complexity of our S3E method is also much lower than other parameterized models.},

We model the semantic meaning of a word in a sentence based on two aspects. One is its relatedness to the word vector subspace already spanned by its contextual words. The other is the word’s novel semantic meaning which shall be introduced as a new basis vector perpendicular to this existing subspace. Following this motivation, we develop an innovative method based on orthogonal basis to combine pre-trained word embeddings into sentence representations. This approach requires zero parameters, along with efficient inference performance. We evaluate our approach on 11 downstream NLP tasks. Our model shows superior performance compared with non-parameterized alternatives and it is competitive to other approaches relying on either large amounts of labelled data or prolonged training time.},

abstract = {Translating the human microbiome in health and disease requires detailed information about each microbial member—from individual annotated genomes to community functional dynamics to relationships with the host. Toward this goal, phylogenetic descriptions of the microbiome are evolving into mechanistic analyses. Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in metagenomic and metabolomic studies using microbial-driven pathologies as models to understand host–microbiome interactions. These studies are charting community-wide ecological maps that provide insight into microbial determinants of health and disease, layering in impacts of the microbiome at different life stages. Although much is known about early microbiome development, trajectories during aging and later in life require further characterization. The microbiome impacts every organ system and aspect of physiology, often through as-yet-unknown mechanisms. Moreover, the influence of the microbiome extends beyond the local environment: neuroactive molecules produced by gut commensals reach the brain to mediate mood, depression, and mental illness [1]. Understanding the principles that govern a healthy microbiome establishes a framework for interrogating perturbations associated with disease or diet and for developing interventional strategies. Unlike the genome, the microbiome is a dynamic reflection of health status that can be modified and, therefore, represents a largely untapped reservoir of opportunity to understand and exploit mechanisms that influence human physiology. This special issue of Genome Medicine highlights the advances made in understanding strain diversity, microbial biochemistry, disease risk, and clinical outcomes. In this Editorial, I highlight key areas and recent progress that has been made in the field toward translating the microbiome and defining the many pathways that modulate host biology.},

Machine learning techniques utilizing additional environmental information about a predicted binding site (such as distances from the site to particular chromatin features) to determine its occupancy/functionality class show promise as methods to achieve more accurate prediction of true TFBS in silico. We evaluate the Bayesian Network (BN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning techniques on four distinct TFBS data sets and analyze their performance. We describe the features that are most useful for classification and contrast and compare these feature sets between the factors. Results Our results demonstrate good performance of classifiers both on TFBS for transcription factors used for initial training and for TFBS for other factors in cross-classification experiments. We find that distances to chromatin modifications (specifically, histone modification islands) as well as distances between such modifications to be effective predictors of TFBS occupancy, though the impact of individual predictors is largely TF specific. In our experiments, Bayesian network classifiers outperform SVM classifiers. Conclusions Our results demonstrate good performance of machine learning techniques on the problem of occupancy classification, and demonstrate that effective classification can be achieved using distances to chromatin features. We additionally demonstrate that cross-classification of TFBS is possible, suggesting the possibility of constructing a generalizable occupancy classifier capable of handling TFBS for many different transcription factors.},

However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model.

In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

abstract = {Although researches on word embeddings have made great progress in recent years, many tasks in natural language processing are on the sentence level. Thus, it is essential to learn sentence embeddings. Recently, Sentence BERT (SBERT) is proposed to learn embeddings on the sentence level, and it uses the inner product (or, cosine similarity) to compute semantic similarity between sentences. However, this measurement cannot well describe the semantic structures among sentences. The reason is that sentences may lie on a manifold in the ambient space rather than distribute in a Euclidean space. Thus, cosine similarity cannot approximate distances on the manifold. To tackle the severe problem, we propose a novel sentence embedding method called Sentence BERT with Locality Preserving (SBERT-LP), which discovers the sentence submanifold from a high-dimensional space and yields a compact sentence representation subspace by locally preserving geometric structures of sentences. We compare the SBERT-LP with several existing sentence embedding approaches from three perspectives: sentence similarity, sentence classification, and sentence clustering. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that our method encodes sentences better in the sense of semantic structures.},

This data is of many different varieties, and can be of different levels of veracity e.g., precise, imprecise, uncertain, and missing, making it challenging to extract important information from such data. Yet, efficient analyses of this continuously growing and evolving COVID-19 data is crucial to inform -- often in real-time -- the relevant measures needed for controlling, mitigating, and ultimately avoiding viral spread. Applying machine learning based algorithms to this big data is a natural approach to take to this aim, since they can quickly scale to such data, and extract the relevant information in the presence of variety and different levels of veracity. This is important for COVID-19, and for potential future pandemics in general. In this paper, we design a straightforward encoding of clinical data (on categorical attributes) into a fixed-length feature vector representation, and then propose a model that first performs efficient feature selection from such representation. We apply this approach on two clinical datasets of the COVID-19 patients and then apply different machine learning algorithms downstream for classification purposes. We show that with the efficient feature selection algorithm, we can achieve a prediction accuracy of more than 90\% in most cases. We also computed the importance of different attributes in the dataset using information gain. This can help the policy makers to focus on only certain attributes for the purposes of studying this disease rather than focusing on multiple random factors that may not be very informative to patient outcomes.},

We learn sentence encoders by training them to distinguish between consistent and inconsistent examples, the latter being generated by randomly perturbing consistent examples in six different ways. Extensive evaluation on several transfer learning and linguistic probing tasks shows improved performance over strong unsupervised and supervised baselines, substantially surpassing them in several cases. Our best results are achieved by training sentence encoders in a multitask setting and by an ensemble of encoders trained on the individual tasks.},

abstract = {Text classification is one of the most widely studied tasks in natural language processing. Motivated by the principle of compositionality, large multilayer neural network models have been employed for this task in an attempt to effectively utilize the constituent expressions. Almost all of the reported work train large networks using discriminative approaches, which come with a caveat of no proper capacity control, as they tend to latch on to any signal that may not generalize. Using various recent state-of-the-art approaches for text classification, we explore whether these models actually learn to compose the meaning of the sentences or still just focus on some keywords or lexicons for classifying the document. To test our hypothesis, we carefully construct datasets where the training and test splits have no direct overlap of such lexicons, but overall language structure would be similar. We study various text classifiers and observe that there is a big performance drop on these datasets. Finally, we show that even simple models with our proposed regularization techniques, which disincentivize focusing on key lexicons, can substantially improve classification accuracy.},

abstract = {Background The advance of metagenomic studies provides the opportunity to identify microbial taxa that are associated to human diseases. Multiple methods exist for the association analysis. However, the results could be inconsistent, presenting challenges in interpreting the host-microbiome interactions. To address this issue, we introduce Meta-Signer, a novel Metagenomic Signature Identifier tool based on rank aggregation of features identified from multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, LASSO, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, and our recently developed Convolutional Neural Network framework (PopPhy-CNN). Meta-Signer generates ranked taxa lists by training individual machine learning models over multiple training partitions and aggregates them into a single ranked list by an optimization procedure to represent the most informative and robust microbial features. Meta-Signer can rank taxa using two input forms of the data: the relative abundances of the original taxa and taxa from the populated taxonomic trees generated from the original taxa. The latter form allows the evaluation of the association of microbial features at different taxonomic levels to the disease, which is attributed to our novel model of PopPhy-CNN. Results We evaluate Mega-Signer on five different human gut-microbiome datasets. We demonstrate that the features derived from Meta-Signer were more informative compared to those obtained from other available feature ranking methods. The highly ranked features are strongly supported by published literature. Conclusion Meta-Signer is capable of deriving a robust set of microbial features at multiple taxonomic levels for the prediction of host phenotype. Meta-Signer is user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to explore their datasets quickly and efficiently.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of the host phenotype from a metagenomic sample and identification of the associated microbial markers are important in understanding potential host-microbiome interactions related to disease initiation and progression. We introduce PopPhy-CNN, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) learning framework that effectively exploits phylogenetic structure in microbial taxa for host phenotype prediction. Our approach takes an input format of a 2D matrix representing the phylogenetic tree populated with the relative abundance of microbial taxa in a metagenomic sample. This conversion empowers CNNs to explore the spatial relationship of the taxonomic annotations on the tree and their quantitative characteristics in metagenomic data. We show the competitiveness of our model compared to other available methods using nine metagenomic datasets of moderate size for binary classification. With synthetic and biological datasets, we show the superior and robust performance of our model for multi-class classification. Furthermore, we design a novel scheme for feature extraction from the learned CNN models and demonstrate improved performance when the extracted features. PopPhy-CNN is a practical deep learning framework for the prediction of host phenotype with the ability of facilitating the retrieval of predictive microbial taxa.},

abstract = {We present curatedMetagenomicData, a Bioconductor and command-line resource providing thousands of metagenomic profiles from the Human Microbiome Project and other publicly available datasets, and ExperimentHub, for convenient cloud-based distribution of data to the R desktop. curatedMetagenomicData provides standardized per-participant metadata linked to bacterial, fungal, archaeal, and viral taxonomic abundances, as well as quantitative metabolic functional profiles, generated by the HUMAnN2 and MetaPhlAn2 pipelines. The resulting datasets can be immediately analyzed with a wide range of statistical methods, requiring a minimum of bioinformatic expertise and no preprocessing of data. We demonstrate exploratory data analysis, an investigation of gut "enterotypes", and a comparison of the accuracy of disease classification from different data types. These documented analyses can be reproduced efficiently on a laptop, without the barriers of working with large-scale, raw sequencing data. The development of curatedMetagenomicData will continue with the addition, curation, and analysis of further microbiome datasets.},
