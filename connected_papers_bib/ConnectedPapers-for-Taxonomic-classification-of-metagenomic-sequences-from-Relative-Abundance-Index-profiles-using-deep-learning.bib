abstract = {Abstract We propose a Convolutional Neural Network approach based on k-mer representation for metagenomic fragment classification problem. The proposed model consists of two steps; the first step is representation of DNA based on k-mer frequency with Relative Abundance Index (RAI) and the second step is classification metagenomic fragments with CNN. RAI scores, as DNA fragment representations are fed to CNN classifiers (CNN-RAI). RAI consist of the over- and under abundance statistics gathered from the taxon for each k-mer. In order to compare the performances of CNN-RAI and RAIphy, which classifies metagenomic fragments using the same input attributes with an expectation-maximization based approach, databases of different metagenomic scenarios were tested. Metagenomics data that were generated (or simulated) by different Next-Generation Sequencing platforms, respectively Illumina technology and Oxford Nanopore MinION were compiled into shotgun metagenomics or 16S rRNA datasets. RAI based method and CNN models were trained on represented data with read lengths ranging between 200 and 10,000 bp, also with distinct k-mer size ( 3 ≤ k ≤ 7 ) at genus level. RAI score was used for the first time in the deep learning algorithm as a spectral representation with improved performance thanks to the ability of deep learning on each dataset for a range of parameters. The proposed representation was compared to the current spectral methods and shown to be competitive for all datasets used in this study.},

abstract = {Metagenomics is a next-generation omics field currently impacting postgenomic life sciences and medicine. Binning metagenomic reads is essential for the understanding of microbial function, compositions, and interactions in given environments. Despite the existence of dozens of computational methods for metagenomic read binning, it is still very challenging to bin reads. This is especially true for reads from unknown species, from species with similar abundance, and/or from low-abundance species in environmental samples. In this study, we developed a novel taxonomy-dependent and alignment-free approach called MBMC (Metagenomic Binning by Markov Chains). Different from all existing methods, MBMC bins reads by measuring the similarity of reads to the trained Markov chains for different taxa instead of directly comparing reads with known genomic sequences. By testing on more than 24 simulated and experimental datasets with species of similar abundance, species of low abundance, and/or unknown species, we report here that MBMC reliably grouped reads from different species into separate bins. Compared with four existing approaches, we demonstrated that the performance of MBMC was comparable with existing approaches when binning reads from sequenced species, and superior to existing approaches when binning reads from unknown species. MBMC is a pivotal tool for binning metagenomic reads in the current era of Big Data and postgenomic integrative biology.

abstract = {Fast mapping of sequencing reads to taxonomic clades is a crucial step in metagenomics, which however raises computational challenges as the numbers of reads and of taxonomic clades increases. Besides alignment-based methods, which are accurate but computational costly, faster compositional approaches have recently been proposed to predict the taxonomic clade of a read based on the set of k-mers it contains. Machine learning-based compositional approaches, in particular, have recently reached accuracies similar to alignment-based models, while being considerably faster. It has been observed that the accuracy of these models increases with the length k of the k-mers they use, however existing methods are limited to handle k-mers of lengths up to k = 12 or 13 because of their large memory footprint needed to store the model coefficients for each possible k-mer. In order to explore the performance of machine learning-based compositional approaches for longer k-mers than currently possible, we propose to reduce the memory footprint of these methods by binning together k-mers that appear together in the sequencing reads used to train the models. We achieve this binning by learning a vector embedding for the vertices of a compacted de Bruijn graph, allowing us to embed any DNA sequence in a low-dimensional vector space where a machine learning system can be trained. The resulting method, which we call Brume, allows us to train compositional machine learning-based models with k-mers of length up to k = 31. We show on two metagenomics benchmark that Brume reaches better performance than previously achieved, thanks to the use of longer k-mers.},

abstract = {There is significant variability in classification accuracy, precision, and resource consumption of sequence classification programs when used to analyze various metagenomics data sets. BackgroundA fundamental problem in modern genomics is to taxonomically or functionally classify DNA sequence fragments derived from environmental sampling (i.e., metagenomics). Several different methods have been proposed for doing this effectively and efficiently, and many have been implemented in software. In addition to varying their basic algorithmic approach to classification, some methods screen sequence reads for ’barcoding genes’ like 16S rRNA, or various types of protein-coding genes. Due to the sheer number and complexity of methods, it can be difficult for a researcher to choose one that is well-suited for a particular analysis.ResultsWe divided the very large number of programs that have been released in recent years for solving the sequence classification problem into three main categories based on the general algorithm they use to compare a query sequence against a database of sequences. We also evaluated the performance of the leading programs in each category on data sets whose taxonomic and functional composition is known.ConclusionsWe found significant variability in classification accuracy, precision, and resource consumption of sequence classification programs when used to analyze various metagenomics data sets. However, we observe some general trends and patterns that will be useful to researchers who use sequence classification programs.},

As proof of principle, we sequenced two metagenomic samples, a known viral mixture of 25 human pathogens and an unknown complex biological model using benchtop technology. The datasets were then analysed using a bioinformatic pipeline developed around recent fast classification methods. A targeted approach was able to detect 20 of the viruses against a background of host contamination from multiple sources and bacterial contamination. An alternative untargeted identification method was highly correlated with these classifications, and over 1,600 species were identified when applied to the complex biological model, including several species captured at over 50% genome coverage. In summary, this study demonstrates the great potential of applying metagenomics within the clinical laboratory setting and that this can be achieved using infrastructure available to nondedicated sequencing centres.},

With recent advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, we have vastly greater quantities of microbial genome data, but the nature of environmental samples is such that DNA from different species are mixed together. Here, we present Opal for metagenomic binning, the task of identifying the origin species of DNA sequencing reads. Our Opal method introduces low-density, even-coverage hashing to bioinformatics applications, enabling quick and accurate metagenomic binning. Our tool is up to two orders of magnitude faster than leading alignment-based methods at similar or improved accuracy, allowing computational tractability on large metagenomic datasets. Moreover, on public benchmarks, Opal is substantially more accurate than both alignment-based and alignment-free methods (e.g. on SimHC20.500, Opal achieves 95% F1-score while Kraken and CLARK achieve just 91% and 88%, respectively); this improvement is likely due to the fact that the latter methods cannot handle computationally-costly long-range dependencies, which our even-coverage, low-density fingerprints resolve. Notably, capturing these long-range dependencies drastically improves Opal’s ability to detect unknown species that share a genus or phylum with known bacteria. Additionally, the family of hash functions Opal uses can be generalized to other sequence analysis tasks that rely on k-mer based methods to encode long-range dependencies.},

Recent attempts using deep learning focus on architectures that classify single DNA reads independently from each other. In this work, we attempt to solve the task of directly predicting the distribution over the taxa of whole metagenomic read sets. We formulate this task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. We extend architectures used in single-read taxonomic classification with two different types of permutation-invariant MIL pooling layers: a) deepsets and b) attention-based pooling. We illustrate that our architecture can exploit the co-occurrence of species in metagenomic read sets and outperforms the single-read architectures in predicting the distribution over the taxa at higher taxonomic ranks.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Compared with composition-based binning algorithms, the binning accuracy and specificity of alignment-based binning algorithms is significantly higher. However, being alignment-based, the latter class of algorithms require enormous amount of time and computing resources for binning huge metagenomic datasets. The motivation was to develop a binning approach that can analyze metagenomic datasets as rapidly as composition-based approaches, but nevertheless has the accuracy and specificity of alignment-based algorithms. This article describes a hybrid binning approach (SPHINX) that achieves high binning efficiency by utilizing the principles of both 'composition'- and 'alignment'-based binning algorithms.


RESULTS
Validation results with simulated sequence datasets indicate that SPHINX is able to analyze metagenomic sequences as rapidly as composition-based algorithms. Furthermore, the binning efficiency (in terms of accuracy and specificity of assignments) of SPHINX is observed to be comparable with results obtained using alignment-based algorithms.

Besides providing valuable insights into the inherent structure of the microbial populations, these studies have potential applications in several important areas of medical research like disease diagnostics, detection of pathogenic contamination and identification of hitherto unknown pathogens. Here we present a novel and rapid, alignment-free method called HabiSign, which utilizes patterns of tetra-nucleotide usage in microbial genomes to bring out the differences in the composition of both diverse and related microbial communities.ResultsValidation results show that the metagenomic signatures obtained using the HabiSign method are able to accurately cluster metagenomes at biome, phenotypic and species levels, as compared to an average tetranucleotide frequency based approach and the recently published dinucleotide relative abundance based approach. More importantly, the method is able to identify subsets of sequences that are specific to a particular habitat. Apart from this, being alignment-free, the method can rapidly compare and group multiple metagenomic data sets in a short span of time.ConclusionsThe proposed method is expected to have immense applicability in diverse areas of metagenomic research ranging from disease diagnostics and pathogen detection to bio-prospecting.

abstract = {Currently metagenomics has been rapid developed, but some problems in the study are still far from being solved. One of these problems is how to group the DNA fragments from a sequenced metagenome, because most of metagenomes are complex mixtures of DNA fragments from multiple unknown organisms. Some classifiers have been developed to class the unknown DNA fragments of metagenomes. However, these classifiers usually suffer from the lower classification accuracy at higher taxonomic levels (family, genus). One of the reasons is the classifiers cannot discriminate the data from different organism accurately, especially the training data contains some outliers such as lateral gene transfer. Here, we presented a novel model, which consists of training and classification phases. In training phase, each taxonomic class can be divided into three cases: accept, uncertain and reject by two approximation concentric hyperspheres based on support vector data description (SVDD) model. By doing so, the discriminating ability of the classifier is enhanced. In classification phase, we designed a score strategy to deduce their optimal taxonomic group for the unknown DNA fragments at correspond taxonomic level. Experiments were performanced on four simulated metagenomes with sequence lengths ranging from 500 bp to 3,000 bp, our classifier has classification accuracy from 63.17 % to 85.6 %, the result is better than most of existing classifiers.},

abstract = {Metagenomic binning is an essential task in analyzing metagenomic sequence datasets. To analyze structure or function of microbial communities from environmental samples, metagenomic sequence fragments are assigned to their taxonomic origins. Although sequence alignment algorithms can readily be used and usually provide high-resolution alignments and accurate binning results, the computational cost of such alignment-based methods becomes prohibitive as metagenomic datasets continue to grow. Alternative compositional-based methods, which exploit sequence composition by profiling local short k-mers in fragments, are often faster but less accurate than alignment-based methods. Inspired by the success of linear error correcting codes in noisy channel communication, we introduce Opal, a fast and accurate novel compositional-based binning method. It incorporates ideas from Gallager's low-density parity-check code to design a family of compact and discriminative locality-sensitive hashing functions that encode long-range compositional dependencies in long fragments. By incorporating the Gallager LSH functions as features in a simple linear SVM, Opal provides fast, accurate and robust binning for datasets consisting of a large number of species, even with mutations and sequencing errors. Opal not only performs up to two orders of magnitude faster than BWA, an alignment-based binning method, but also achieves improved binning accuracy and robustness to sequencing errors. Opal also outperforms models built on traditional k-mer profiles in terms of robustness and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that we can effectively use Opal in the "coarse search" stage of a compressive genomics pipeline to identify a much smaller candidate set of taxonomic origins for a subsequent alignment-based method to analyze, thus providing metagenomic binning with high scalability, high accuracy and high resolution.},

Metagenomic read classification is a critical step in the identification and quantification of microbial species sampled by high-throughput sequencing.

Due to the growing popularity of metagenomic data in both basic science and clinical applications, as well as the increasing volume of data being generated, efficient and accurate algorithms are in high demand.


Results
We introduce MetaOthello, a probabilistic hashing classifier for metagenomic sequencing reads. The algorithm employs a novel data structure, called l-Othello, to support efficient querying of a taxon using its k-mer signatures. MetaOthello is an order-of-magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art algorithms Kraken and Clark, and requires only one-third of the RAM. In comparison to Kaiju, a metagenomic classification tool using protein sequences instead of genomic sequences, MetaOthello is three times faster and exhibits 20-30% higher classification sensitivity. We report comparative analyses of both scalability and accuracy using a number of simulated and empirical datasets.

MetaOthello is a stand-alone program implemented in C ++. The current version (1.0) is accessible via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.808941.

abstract = {Characterizing the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities is one of the primary objectives of metagenomic studies. Taxonomic analysis of microbial communities, a process referred to as binning, is challenging for the following reasons. Primarily, query sequences originating from the genomes of most microbes in an environmental sample lack taxonomically related sequences in existing reference databases. This absence of a taxonomic context makes binning a very challenging task. Limitations of current sequencing platforms, with respect to short read lengths and sequencing errors/artifacts, are also key factors that determine the overall binning efficiency. Furthermore, the sheer volume of metagenomic datasets also demands highly efficient algorithms that can operate within reasonable requirements of compute power. This review discusses the premise, methodologies, advantages, limitations and challenges of various methods available for binning of metagenomic datasets obtained using the shotgun sequencing approach. Various parameters as well as strategies used for evaluating binning efficiency are then reviewed.},

abstract = {Bacterial microbiomes of incredible complexity are found throughout the world, from exotic marine locations to the soil in our yards to within our very guts. With recent advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, we have vastly greater quantities of microbial genome data, but the nature of environmental samples is such that DNA from different species are mixed together. Here, we present Opal for metagenomic binning, the task of identifying the origin species of DNA sequencing reads. Our Opal method introduces low-density, even-coverage hashing to bioinformatics applications, enabling quick and accurate metagenomic binning. Our tool is up to two orders of magnitude faster than leading alignment-based methods at similar or improved accuracy, allowing computational tractability on large metagenomic datasets. Moreover, on public benchmarks, Opal is substantially more accurate than both alignment-based and alignment-free methods (e.g. on SimHC20.500, Opal achieves 95% F1-score while Kraken and CLARK achieve just 91% and 88%, respectively); this improvement is likely due to the fact that the latter methods cannot handle computationally-costly long-range dependencies, which our even-coverage, low-density fingerprints resolve. Notably, capturing these long-range dependencies drastically improves Opal’s ability to detect unknown species that share a genus or phylum with known bacteria. Additionally, the family of hash functions Opal uses can be generalized to other sequence analysis tasks that rely on k-mer based methods to encode long-range dependencies.},

abstract = {BackgroundTaxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences is the first step in metagenomic analysis. Existing taxonomic classification approaches are of two types, similarity-based and composition-based. Similarity-based approaches, though accurate and specific, are extremely slow. Since, metagenomic projects generate millions of sequences, adopting similarity-based approaches becomes virtually infeasible for research groups having modest computational resources. In this study, we present INDUS - a composition-based approach that incorporates the following novel features. First, INDUS discards the 'one genome-one composition' model adopted by existing compositional approaches. Second, INDUS uses 'compositional distance' information for identifying appropriate assignment levels. Third, INDUS incorporates steps that attempt to reduce biases due to database representation.ResultsINDUS is able to rapidly classify sequences in both simulated and real metagenomic sequence data sets with classification efficiency significantly higher than existing composition-based approaches. Although the classification efficiency of INDUS is observed to be comparable to those by similarity-based approaches, the binning time (as compared to alignment based approaches) is 23-33 times lower.ConclusionGiven it's rapid execution time, and high levels of classification efficiency, INDUS is expected to be of immense interest to researchers working in metagenomics and microbial ecology.AvailabilityA web-server for the INDUS algorithm is available at http://metagenomics.atc.tcs.com/INDUS/},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of microbial community composition based on metagenomic sequencing data is fundamental for subsequent metagenomics analysis. Prevalent estimation methods are mainly based on directly summarizing alignment results or its variants; often result in biased and/or unstable estimates. We have developed a unified probabilistic framework (named GRAMMy) by explicitly modeling read assignment ambiguities, genome size biases and read distributions along the genomes. Maximum likelihood method is employed to compute Genome Relative Abundance of microbial communities using the Mixture Model theory (GRAMMy). GRAMMy has been demonstrated to give estimates that are accurate and robust across both simulated and real read benchmark datasets. We applied GRAMMy to a collection of 34 metagenomic read sets from four metagenomics projects and identified 99 frequent species (minimally 0.5% abundant in at least 50% of the data- sets) in the human gut samples. Our results show substantial improvements over previous studies, such as adjusting the over-estimated abundance for Bacteroides species for human gut samples, by providing a new reference-based strategy for metagenomic sample comparisons. GRAMMy can be used flexibly with many read assignment tools (mapping, alignment or composition-based) even with low-sensitivity mapping results from huge short-read datasets. It will be increasingly useful as an accurate and robust tool for abundance estimation with the growing size of read sets and the expanding database of reference genomes.},

abstract = {An important problem in metagenomic analysis is to determine and quantify species (or genomes) in a metagenomic sample. The identification of phylogenetically related groups of sequence reads in a metagenomic dataset is often referred to as binning. Similarity-based binning methods rely on reference databases, and are unable to classify reads from unknown organisms. Composition-based methods exploit compositional patterns that are preserved in sufficiently long fragments, but are not suitable for binning very short next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads. Recently, several new metagenomic binning algorithms that can deal with NGS reads and do not rely on reference databases have been developed. However, all of them have difficulty with handling samples containing low-abundance species. We propose a new method to accurately estimate the abundance levels of species based on a novel probabilistic model for counting l-mer frequencies in a metagenomic dataset that takes into account frequencies of erroneous l-mers and repeated l-mers. An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the parameters of the model. Our algorithm automatically determines the number of abundance groups in a dataset and bins the reads into these groups. We show that our method outperforms the most recent abundance-based binning method, AbundanceBin, on both simulated and real datasets. We also show that the improved abundance-based binning method can be incorporated into a recent tool TOSS, which separates genomes with similar abundance levels and employs AbundanceBin as a preprocessing step to handle different abundance levels, to enhance its performance. We test the improved TOSS on simulated datasets and show that it significantly outperforms TOSS on datasets containing low-abundance genomes. Finally, we compare this approach against very recent metagenomic binning tools MetaCluster 4.0 and MetaCluster 5.0 on simulated data and demonstrate that it usually achieves a better sensitivity and breaks fewer genomes.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe field of metagenomics (study of genetic material recovered directly from an environment) has grown rapidly, with many bioinformatics analysis methods being developed. To ensure appropriate use of such methods, robust comparative evaluation of their accuracy and features is needed. For taxonomic classification of sequence reads, such evaluation should include use of clade exclusion, which better evaluates a method’s accuracy when identical sequences are not present in any reference database, as is common in metagenomic analysis. To date, relatively small evaluations have been performed, with evaluation approaches like clade exclusion limited to assessment of new methods by the authors of the given method. What is needed is a rigorous, independent comparison between multiple major methods, using the same in silico and in vitro test datasets, with and without approaches like clade exclusion, to better characterize accuracy under different conditions.ResultsAn overview of the features of 38 bioinformatics methods is provided, evaluating accuracy with a focus on 11 programs that have reference databases that can be modified and therefore most robustly evaluated with clade exclusion. Taxonomic classification of sequence reads was evaluated using both in silico and in vitro mock bacterial communities. Clade exclusion was used at taxonomic levels from species to class—identifying how well methods perform in progressively more difficult scenarios. A wide range of variability was found in the sensitivity, precision, overall accuracy, and computational demand for the programs evaluated. In experiments where distilled water was spiked with only 11 bacterial species, frequently dozens to hundreds of species were falsely predicted by the most popular programs. The different features of each method (forces predictions or not, etc.) are summarized, and additional analysis considerations discussed.ConclusionsThe accuracy of shotgun metagenomics classification methods varies widely. No one program clearly outperformed others in all evaluation scenarios; rather, the results illustrate the strengths of different methods for different purposes. Researchers must appreciate method differences, choosing the program best suited for their particular analysis to avoid very misleading results. Use of standardized datasets for method comparisons is encouraged, as is use of mock microbial community controls suitable for a particular metagenomic analysis.},

abstract = {The study of whole microbial communities through RNA-seq, or metatranscriptomics, offers a unique view of the relative levels of activity for different genes across a large number of species simultaneously. To make sense of these sequencing data, it is necessary to be able to assign both taxonomic and functional identities to each sequenced read. High-quality identifications are important not only for community profiling, but to also ensure that functional assignments of sequence reads are correctly attributed to their source taxa. Such assignments allow biochemical pathways to be appropriately allocated to discrete species, enabling the capture of cross-species interactions. Typically read annotation is performed by a single alignment-based search tool such as BLAST. However, due to the vast extent of bacterial diversity, these approaches tend to be highly error prone, particularly for taxonomic assignments. Here we introduce a novel program for generating taxonomic assignments, called Gist, which integrates information from a number of machine learning methods and the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Uniquely Gist establishes the most appropriate weightings of methods for individual genomes, facilitating high classification accuracy on next-generation sequencing reads. We validate our approach using a synthetic metatranscriptome generator based on Flux Simulator, termed Genepuddle. Further, unlike previous taxonomic classifiers, we demonstrate the capacity of composition-based techniques to accurately inform on taxonomic origin without resorting to longer scanning windows that mimic alignment-based methods.

abstract = {As more and more completely sequenced genomes become available, the taxonomic classification of metagenomic data will benefit greatly from supervised classifiers that can be updated instantaneously in response to new genomes. Currently, some supervised classifiers have been developed to assess the organism of metagenomic sequences. We have found that the existing supervised classifiers usually cannot discriminate the training data from different classes accurately when the data contain some outliers. However, the training genomic data (bacterial and archaeal genomes) usually contain a portion of outliers, which come from sequencing errors, phage invasions, and some highly expressed genes, etc. The outliers, treated as noises, prohibit the development of classifiers with better prediction accuracy. To solve the problem, we present a robust supervised classifier, weighted support vector domain description (WSVDD), which can eliminate the interference from some outliers for training genomic data and then generate more accurate data domain descriptions for each taxonomic class. The experimental results demonstrate WSVDD is more robust than other classifiers for simulated Sanger and 454 reads with different outlier rates. In addition, in experiments performed on simulated metagenomes and real gut metagenomes, WSVDD also achieved better prediction accuracy than other classifiers.},

With the advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms, the use of large scale shotgun sequencing approaches is now commonplace. However, a thorough independent benchmark comparing state-of-the-art metagenome analysis tools is lacking. Here we present a benchmark where the most widely used tools are tested on complex, realistic data sets. Our results clearly show that the most widely used tools are not necessarily the most accurate, that the most accurate tool is not necessarily the most time consuming, and that there is a high degree of variability between available tools. These findings are important as the conclusions of any metagenomics study are affected by errors in the predicted community composition and functional capacity.

abstract = {BackgroundIn metagenomic sequence data, majority of sequences/reads originate from new or partially characterized genomes, the corresponding sequences of which are absent in existing reference databases. Since taxonomic assignment of reads is based on their similarity to sequences from known organisms, the presence of reads originating from new organisms poses a major challenge to taxonomic binning methods. The recently published SOrt-ITEMS algorithm uses an elaborate work-flow to assign reads originating from hitherto unknown genomes with significant accuracy and specificity. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of reads still get misclassified. Besides, the use of an alignment-based orthology step (for improving the specificity of assignments) increases the total binning time of SOrt-ITEMS.ResultsIn this paper, we introduce a rapid binning approach called DiScRIBinATE (Di stance Sc ore R atio for I mproved Bin ning A nd T axonomic E stimation). DiScRIBinATE replaces the orthology approach of SOrt-ITEMS with a quicker 'alignment-free' approach. We demonstrate that incorporating this approach reduces binning time by half without any loss in the specificity and accuracy of assignments. Besides, a novel reclassification strategy incorporated in DiScRIBinATE results in reducing the overall misclassification rate to around 3 - 7%. This misclassification rate is 1.5 - 3 times lower as compared to that by SOrt-ITEMS, and 3 - 30 times lower as compared to that by MEGAN.ConclusionsA significant reduction in binning time, coupled with a superior assignment accuracy (as compared to existing binning methods), indicates the immense applicability of the proposed algorithm in rapidly mapping the taxonomic diversity of large metagenomic samples with high accuracy and specificity.AvailabilityThe program is available on request from the authors.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
One of the first steps in metagenomic analysis is the assignment of reads/contigs obtained from various sequencing technologies to their correct taxonomic bins. Similarity-based binning methods assign a read to a taxon/clade, based on the pattern of significant BLAST hits generated against sequence databases. Existing methods, which use bit-score as the sole parameter to ascertain the significance of BLAST hits, have limited specificity and accuracy of binning. A new binning algorithm, called SOrt-ITEMS is introduced, which addresses these limitations. The method uses alignment parameters besides the bit score to first identify an appropriate taxonomic level where the read can be assigned. An orthology-based approach is subsequently used by the method for the final assignment.


RESULTS
The performance of SOrt-ITEMS has been validated with reads simulating sequences from 454 and Sanger sequencing technologies. In addition, the taxonomic composition of the Sargasso Sea data set has been analyzed using SOrt-ITEMS. SOrt-ITEMS shows improved specificity and accuracy of assignments especially in simulated scenarios, wherein sequences corresponding to the source organism of the reads are absent in the reference database.
