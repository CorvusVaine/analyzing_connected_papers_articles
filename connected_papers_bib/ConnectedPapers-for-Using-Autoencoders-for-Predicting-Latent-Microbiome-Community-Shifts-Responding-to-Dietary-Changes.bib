abstract = {Human gut microbiome responds rapidly to diet and has important consequences to host health such as obesity and other metabolic disease. Computational tools of modeling microbiome dynamics responding to diet are import in facilitating the development of effective prebiotic and probiotics for disease prevention and treatment. In this work, we present a deep neural network to predict gut microbiome responding to diet change. Our model uses an autoencoder to capture intrinsic structure in data and an artificial neural network to model the nonlinear dynamics of microbiome. Our evaluation using three time-course datasets of murine gut microbiome shows promising results.},

abstract = {Motivation Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem, which affects millions of people worldwide, and if left unchecked is expected to upend many aspects of healthcare as it is practiced today. Identifying the type of antibiotic resistant genes in genome and metagenomic sample is of utmost importance in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infections. Today there are multiple tools available that predict antibiotic resistance class from DNA and protein sequences, yet there is a lack of benchmarks on the performances of these tools. Results We have developed a dataset that is curated from 15 available databases, and annotated with their antibiotic class labels. We also developed a transfer learning approach with neural networks, TRAC, that outperforms existing antiobiotic resistance prediction tools. While TRAC provides the current state-of-the-art performance, we hope our newly developed dataset will also provide the community with a much needed standardized dataset to develop novel methods that can predict antibiotic resistance class with superior prediction performance.

abstract = {Dynamic changes in microbial communities play an important role in human health and disease. Specifically, deciphering how microbial species in a community interact with each other and their environment can elucidate mechanisms of disease, a problem typically investigated using tools from community ecology. Yet, such methods require measurements of absolute densities, whereas typical datasets only provide estimates of relative abundances. Here, we systematically investigate models of microbial dynamics in the simplex of relative abundances. We derive a new nonlinear dynamical system for microbial dynamics, termed “compositional” Lotka-Volterra (cLV), unifying approaches using generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) equations from community ecology and compositional data analysis. On three real datasets, we demonstrate that cLV recapitulates interactions between relative abundances implied by gLV. Moreover, we show that cLV is as accurate as gLV in forecasting microbial trajectories in terms of relative abundances. We further compare cLV to two other models of relative abundance dynamics motivated by common assumptions in the literature—a linear model in a log-ratio transformed space, and a linear model in the space of relative abundances—and provide evidence that cLV more accurately describes community trajectories over time. Finally, we investigate when information about direct effects can be recovered from relative data that naively provide information about only indirect effects. Our results suggest that strong effects may be recoverable from relative data, but more subtle effects are challenging to identify.},

abstract = {Microbiomes are complex ecological systems that play crucial roles in understanding natural phenomena from human disease to climate change. Especially in human gut microbiome studies, where collecting clinical samples can be arduous, the number of taxa considered in any one study often exceeds the number of samples ten to one hundred-fold. This discrepancy decreases the power of studies to identify meaningful differences between samples, increases the likelihood of false positive results, and subsequently limits reproducibility. Despite the vast collections of microbiome data already available, biome-specific patterns of microbial structure are not currently leveraged to inform studies. Here, we derive microbiome-level properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxon co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies. By providing a set of pre-trained embeddings, we allow any V4 16S amplicon study to apply the publicly informed properties to increase the statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of analysis.},

abstract = {The present study revealed that there is an enterotype-independent assemblage, detected using a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method on a large-scale human gut metagenome dataset and indicated that each individual tends to have several assemblages. Background The human gut microbiome has been suggested to affect human health and thus has received considerable attention. To clarify the structure of the human gut microbiome, clustering methods are frequently applied to human gut taxonomic profiles. Enterotypes, i.e., clusters of individuals with similar microbiome composition, are well-studied and characterized. However, only a few detailed studies on assemblages, i.e., clusters of co-occurring bacterial taxa, have been conducted. Particularly, the relationship between the enterotype and assemblage is not well-understood. Results In this study, we detected gut microbiome assemblages using a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method. We applied LDA to a large-scale human gut metagenome dataset and found that a 4-assemblage LDA model could represent relationships between enterotypes and assemblages with high interpretability. This model indicated that each individual tends to have several assemblages, three of which corresponded to the three classically recognized enterotypes. Conversely, the fourth assemblage corresponded to no enterotypes and emerged in all enterotypes. Interestingly, the dominant genera of this assemblage ( Clostridium , Eubacterium , Faecalibacterium , Roseburia , Coprococcus , and Butyrivibrio ) included butyrate-producing species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii . Indeed, the fourth assemblage significantly positively correlated with three butyrate-producing functions. Conclusions We conducted an assemblage analysis on a large-scale human gut metagenome dataset using LDA. The present study revealed that there is an enterotype-independent assemblage.

As a result, current computational approaches to describe microbial systems rely on incomplete reference databases that cannot adequately capture the full functional diversity of the microbial tree of life, limiting our ability to model high-level features of biological sequences. The scientific community needs a means to capture the functionally and evolutionarily relevant features underlying biology, independent of our incomplete reference databases. Such a model can form the basis for transfer learning tasks, enabling downstream applications in environmental microbiology, medicine, and bioengineering. Here we present LookingGlass, a deep learning model capturing a “universal language of life”. LookingGlass encodes contextually-aware, functionally and evolutionarily relevant representations of short DNA reads, distinguishing reads of disparate function, homology, and environmental origin. We demonstrate the ability of LookingGlass to be fine-tuned to perform a range of diverse tasks: to identify novel oxidoreductases, to predict enzyme optimal temperature, and to recognize the reading frames of DNA sequence fragments. LookingGlass is the first contextually-aware, general purpose pre-trained “biological language” representation model for short-read DNA sequences. LookingGlass enables functionally relevant representations of otherwise unknown and unannotated sequences, shedding light on the microbial dark matter that dominates life on Earth. Availability The pretrained LookingGlass model and the transfer learning-derived models demonstrated in this paper are available in the LookingGlass release v1.01.

abstract = {Escherichia coli is a ubiquitous bacterium that has been widely exposed to antibiotics over the last 70 years.

To do so, we analysed 70 301 E. coli genomes obtained from the EnteroBase database and detected 1 027 651 ARGs using the AMRFinder, Mustard and ResfinderFG ARG databases. We observed a strong phylogroup and clonal lineage specific distribution of some ARGs, supporting the argument for epistasis between ARGs and the strain genetic background. However, each phylogroup had ARGs conferring a similar antibiotic class resistance pattern, indicating phenotypic adaptive convergence. The G+C content or the type of ARG was not associated with the frequency of the ARG in the database. In addition, we identified ARGs from anaerobic, non- Proteobacteria bacteria in four genomes of E. coli , supporting the hypothesis that the transfer between anaerobic bacteria and E. coli can spontaneously occur but remains exceptional. In conclusion, we showed that phylum barrier and intra-species phylogenetic history are major drivers of the acquisition of a resistome in E. coli .},

The gut resistome may be influenced by many factors, but the consumption of antibiotics at both individual and country level should be one of the most significant factors. Previous studies have suggested that the gut resistome of different populations may vary, but lack quantitative characterization supported with relatively large datasets. In this study, we filled the gap by analyzing a large gut resistome dataset of 1,267 human gut samples of America, China, Denmark, and Spain. We built a stacking machine-learning model to determine whether the gut resistome can act as the sole feature to identify the nationality of an individual reliably. It turned out that the machine learning method could successfully identify American, Chinese, Danish, and Spanish populations with F1 score of 0.964, 0.987, 0.971, and 0.986, respectively. Our finding does highlight the significant differences in the composition of the gut resistome among different nationalities.

abstract = {The recent advancements in rapid and affordable DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized diagnostic microbiology and microbial surveillance. The availability of bioinformatics tools and online accessible databases has been a prerequisite for this. We conducted a scientific literature review and here we present a description of examples of available tools and databases for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection and provide future perspectives and recommendations. At least 47 freely accessible bioinformatics resources for detection of AMR determinants in DNA or amino acid sequence data have been developed to date. These include, among others but not limited to, ARG-ANNOT, CARD, SRST2, MEGARes, Genefinder, ARIBA, KmerResistance, AMRFinder, and ResFinder. Bioinformatics resources differ for several parameters including type of accepted input data, presence/absence of software for search within a database of AMR determinants that can be specific to a tool or cloned from other resources, and for the search approach employed, which can be based on mapping or on alignment. As a consequence, each tool has strengths and limitations in sensitivity and specificity of detection of AMR determinants and in application, which for some of the tools have been highlighted in benchmarking exercises and scientific articles. The identified tools are either available at public genome data centers, from GitHub or can be run locally. NCBI and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) provide possibilities for online submission of both sequencing and accompanying phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility data, allowing for other researchers to further analyze data, and develop and test new tools. The advancement in whole genome sequencing and the application of online tools for real-time detection of AMR determinants are essential to identify control and prevention strategies to combat the increasing threat of AMR. Accessible tools and DNA sequence data are expanding, which will allow establishing global pathogen surveillance and AMR tracking based on genomics. There is however, a need for standardization of pipelines and databases as well as phenotypic predictions based on the data.},

abstract = {A crucial process in the production of industrial enzymes is recombinant gene expression, which aims to induce enzyme overexpression of the genes in a host microbe. Current approaches for securing overexpression rely on molecular tools such as adjusting the recombinant expression vector, adjusting cultivation conditions, or performing codon optimizations. However, such strategies are time-consuming, and an alternative strategy would be to select genes for better compatibility with the recombinant host. Several methods for predicting soluble expression are available; however, they are all optimized for the expression host Escherichia coli and do not consider the possibility of an expressed protein not being soluble. We show that these tools are not suited for predicting expression potential in the industrially important host Bacillus subtilis. Instead, we build a B. subtilis-specific machine learning model for expressibility prediction. Given millions of unlabelled proteins and a small labeled dataset, we can successfully train such a predictive model. The unlabeled proteins provide a performance boost relative to using amino acid frequencies of the labeled proteins as input. On average, we obtain a modest performance of 0.64 area-under-the-curve (AUC) and 0.2 Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). However, we find that this is sufficient for the prioritization of expression candidates for high-throughput studies. Moreover, the predicted class probabilities are correlated with expression levels. A number of features related to protein expression, including base frequencies and solubility, are captured by the model.},

Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes & Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants. Here, we describe updates and recent expansions to CARD and its biocuration process, including new resources for community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION
Curation of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) databases is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge to manually collect, correct, and/or annotate individual genes. Consequently, most existing ARG databases contain only a small number of ARGs (∼5k genes) and updates to these databases tend to be infrequent, commonly requiring years for completion and often containing inconsistencies. Thus, a new approach is needed to achieve a truly comprehensive ARG database while also maintaining a high level of accuracy.


IMPLEMENTATION
Here we propose a new web-based curation system, ARGminer, that supports the annotation and inspection of several key attributes of potential ARGs, including gene name, antibiotic category, resistance mechanism, evidence for mobility and occurrence in clinically-important bacterial strains. We apply crowdsourcing as a novel strategy to overcome limitations of manual curation and expand curation capacity towards achieving a truly comprehensive and perpetually up-to-date database. Further, machine learning is employed as a means to validate database curation, drawing from natural language processing to infer correct and consistent nomenclature for each potential ARG.


RESULTS
We develop and validate the crowdsourcing approach by comparing performances of multiple cohorts of curators with varying levels of expertise, thus demonstrating that ARGminer is a time and cost efficient means of achieving accurate ARG curation. We further demonstrate the reliability of a trust validation filter for rejecting input generated by spammers. Crowdsourcing was found to be as accurate as expert annotation, with an accuracy >90% for the annotation of a diverse test set of ARGs.


AVAILABILITY
The ARGminer public search platform and database is available at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/argminer.

abstract = {Tuberculosis treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics such as rifampicin, streptomycin and fluoroquinolones, which are also used against other pathogenic bacteria. We developed Drug Resistance Associated Genes database (DRAGdb), a manually curated repository of mutational data of drug resistance associated genes (DRAGs) across ESKAPE (i.e. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens, and other bacteria with a special focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Analysis of mutations in drug-resistant genes listed in DRAGdb suggested both homoplasy and pleiotropy to be associated with resistance. Homoplasy was observed in six genes namely gidB, gyrA, gyrB, rpoB, rpsL and rrs. For these genes, drug resistance-associated mutations at codon level were conserved in MTB, ESKAPE and many other bacteria. Pleiotropy was exemplified by a single nucleotide mutation that was associated with resistance to amikacin, gentamycin, rifampicin and vancomycin in Staphylococcus aureus. DRAGdb data also revealed that mutations in some genes such as pncA, inhA, katG and embA,B,C were specific to Mycobacterium species. For inhA and pncA, the mutations in the promoter region along with those in coding regions were associated with resistance to isoniazid and pyrazinamide respectively. In summary, the DRAGdb database is a compilation of all the major MTB drug resistance genes across bacterial species, which allows identification of homoplasy and pleiotropy phenomena of DRAGs.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a significant public health problem worldwide. In recent years, the scientific community has been intensifying efforts to combat this problem; many experiments have been developed, and many articles are published in this area. However, the growing volume of biological literature increases the difficulty of the biocuration process due to the cost and time required. Modern text mining tools with the adoption of artificial intelligence technology are helpful to assist in the evolution of research. In this article, we propose a text mining model capable of identifying and ranking prioritizing scientific articles in the context of antimicrobial resistance. We retrieved scientific articles from the PubMed database, adopted machine learning techniques to generate the vector representation of the retrieved scientific articles, and identified their similarity with the context. As a result of this process, we obtained a dataset labeled “Relevant” and “Irrelevant” and used this dataset to implement one supervised learning algorithm to classify new records. The model’s overall performance reached 90% accuracy and the f-measure (harmonic mean between the metrics) reached 82% accuracy for positive class and 93% for negative class, showing quality in the identification of scientific articles relevant to the context.

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance monitoring is of paramount importance in the face of this ongoing global epidemic. Using traditional alignment based methods to detect antibiotic resistant genes results in huge number of false negatives. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning model based on a self-attention architecture that can classify antibiotic resistant genes into correct classes with high precision and recall by just using protein sequences as input. Additionally, deep learning models trained with traditional optimization algorithms (e.g. Adam, SGD) provide poor posterior estimates when tested against Out-of-Distribution (OoD) antibiotic resistant/non-resistant genes. We train our model with an optimization method called Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (pSGLD) which provides reliable uncertainty estimates when tested against OoD data.},

abstract = {Background The spread of antibiotic resistance has become one of the most urgent threats to global health, which is estimated to cause 700,000 deaths each year globally. Its surrogates, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), are highly transmittable between food, water, animal, and human to mitigate the efficacy of antibiotics. Accurately identifying ARGs is thus an indispensable step to understanding the ecology, and transmission of ARGs between environmental and human-associated reservoirs. Unfortunately, the previous computational methods for identifying ARGs are mostly based on sequence alignment, which cannot identify novel ARGs, and their applications are limited by currently incomplete knowledge about ARGs. Results Here, we propose an end-to-end Hierarchical Multi-task Deep learning framework for ARG annotation (HMD-ARG). Taking raw sequence encoding as input, HMD-ARG can identify, without querying against existing sequence databases, multiple ARG properties simultaneously, including if the input protein sequence is an ARG, and if so, what antibiotic family it is resistant to, what resistant mechanism the ARG takes, and if the ARG is an intrinsic one or acquired one. In addition, if the predicted antibiotic family is beta-lactamase, HMD-ARG further predicts the subclass of beta-lactamase that the ARG is resistant to. Comprehensive experiments, including cross-fold validation, third-party dataset validation in human gut microbiota, wet-experimental functional validation, and structural investigation of predicted conserved sites, demonstrate not only the superior performance of our method over the state-of-art methods, but also the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Conclusions We propose a hierarchical multi-task method, HMD-ARG, which is based on deep learning and can provide detailed annotations of ARGs from three important aspects: resistant antibiotic class, resistant mechanism, and gene mobility. We believe that HMD-ARG can serve as a powerful tool to identify antibiotic resistance genes and, therefore mitigate their global threat.

abstract = {Background The study of resistomes using whole metagenomic sequencing enables access to the large repertoire of resistance genes usually found in complex microbial communities, such as the human microbiome. Over recent years, sophisticated and diverse pipelines have been established to facilitate raw data processing and annotation. Despite the progress, there are no easy-to-use tools for comprehensive visual, statistical, and functional analysis of resistome data. Thus, exploration of the resulting large complex datasets remains a key bottleneck requiring robust computational resources and technical expertise, which creates a significant hurdle for advancements in the field. Results Here, we introduce ResistoXplorer, a user-friendly tool that integrates recent advancements in statistics and visualization, coupled with extensive functional annotations and phenotype collection, to enable high-throughput analysis of common outputs generated from resistome studies. ResistoXplorer contains three modules-the ‘Antimicrobial Resistance Gene Table’ module offers various options for composition profiling, functional profiling and comparative analysis of resistome data; the ‘Integration’ module supports integrative exploratory analysis of resistome and microbiome abundance profiles in metagenomic samples; finally, the ‘Antimicrobial Resistance Gene List’ module enables users to explore antimicrobial resistance genes according to function and potential microbial hosts using visual analytics to gain biological insights. Within these three modules, ResistoXplorer offers comprehensive assistance for ARG functional annotations along with their microbe and phenotype associations based on data collected from >10 reference databases. In addition, it provides support for a variety of methods for composition profiling, visualization and exploratory data analysis, as well as extensive support for various data normalization methods and machine learning algorithms for identification of resistome signatures. Finally, ResistoXplorer offers also network visualization for intuitive exploration of associations between antimicrobial resistance genes and the microbial hosts, incorporated with functional enrichment analysis support. Conclusions ResistoXplorer is a web-based tool with a user-friendly interface that enables comprehensive and real-time downstream analysis of resistome data. As such, it allows for in-depth exploration of metagenomic datasets focusing on the intrinsic networks and correlations of antimicrobial resistance genes and their underlying microbial determinants. ResistoXplorer will assist researchers and clinicians in the field of AMR to facilitate discovery in large-scale and multi-dimensional metagenomic datasets.

abstract = {Antibiotic or antimicrobial resistance (AR) facilitated by the vertical and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), is a serious global health challenge. While traditionally associated with pathogens in clinical environments, it is becoming increasingly clear that non-clinical environments may also be reservoirs of ARGs. The recent improvements in rapid and affordable next generation sequencing technologies along with sophisticated bioinformatics platforms has the potential to revolutionize diagnostic microbiology and microbial surveillance. Through the study and characterization of ARGs in bacterial genomes and complex metagenomes, we are now able to reveal the genetic scope of AR in single bacteria and complex communities, and obtain important insights into AR dynamics at species, population and community levels, providing novel epidemiological and ecological perspectives. A suite of bioinformatics pipelines and ARG databases are currently available for genomic and metagenomic data analyses. However, different platforms may significantly vary and therefore, it is crucial to choose the tools that are most suitable for the specific analysis being conducted. This review provides a detailed account of available bioinformatics platforms for identification and characterization of ARGs and associated genetic elements within single bacterial isolates and complex environmental samples. It focuses primarily on currently available ARG databases, employing a comprehensive benchmarking pipeline to identify ARGs in four bacterial genomes (Aeromonas salmonicida, Bacillus cereus, Burkholderia sp. and Escherichia coli) and three shotgun metagenomes (human gut, poultry litter and soil) providing insight into which databases should be used for different analytical scenarios.},

abstract = {Resistance genes encoding β-lactamases (BLs) confer resistance to the widely prescribed antibiotic class β-lactams. Therefore, it is important to assess the prevalence of BL genes in clinical or environmental samples for monitoring the spreading of these genes into pathogens and estimating public health risk. ABSTRACT Identification of genes encoding β-lactamases (BLs) from short-read sequences remains challenging due to the high frequency of shared amino acid functional domains and motifs in proteins encoded by BL genes and related non-BL gene sequences. Divergent BL homologs can be frequently missed during similarity searches, which has important practical consequences for monitoring antibiotic resistance. To address this limitation, we built ROCker models that targeted broad classes (e.g., class A, B, C, and D) and individual families (e.g., TEM) of BLs and challenged them with mock 150-bp- and 250-bp-read data sets of known composition. ROCker identifies most-discriminant bit score thresholds in sliding windows along the sequence of the target protein sequence and hence can account for nondiscriminative domains shared by unrelated proteins. BL ROCker models showed a 0% false-positive rate (FPR), a 0% to 4% false-negative rate (FNR), and an up-to-50-fold-higher F1 score [2 × precision × recall/(precision + recall)] compared to alternative methods, such as similarity searches using BLASTx with various e-value thresholds and BL hidden Markov models, or tools like DeepARG, ShortBRED, and AMRFinder. The ROCker models and the underlying protein sequence reference data sets and phylogenetic trees for read placement are freely available through http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu/data/rocker-bla. Application of these BL ROCker models to metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and high-throughput PCR gene amplicon data should facilitate the reliable detection and quantification of BL variants encoded by environmental or clinical isolates and microbiomes and more accurate assessment of the associated public health risk, compared to the current practice. IMPORTANCE Resistance genes encoding β-lactamases (BLs) confer resistance to the widely prescribed antibiotic class β-lactams. Therefore, it is important to assess the prevalence of BL genes in clinical or environmental samples for monitoring the spreading of these genes into pathogens and estimating public health risk. However, detecting BLs in short-read sequence data is technically challenging. Our ROCker model-based bioinformatics approach showcases the reliable detection and typing of BLs in complex data sets and thus contributes toward solving an important problem in antibiotic resistance surveillance. The ROCker models developed substantially expand the toolbox for monitoring antibiotic resistance in clinical or environmental settings.},

abstract = {Objectives Evaluation of a computerised electrocardiogram algorithm compared to the interpretation of a team of board‐certified veterinary cardiologists. Materials and Methods This was a cross‐sectional retrospective cohort study. A total of 399 electronic canine electrocardiogram recordings screened from 1391 electrocardiograms were enrolled in the study. A panel of seven cardiologists, masked to patient information, evaluated electrocardiograms for the following: P‐wave amplitude and duration; PR‐interval; R‐wave amplitude; QRS duration; heart rate; mean electrical axis; and final overall diagnosis for the detection of arrhythmia and any abnormal electrocardiogram anomaly. Results The sensitivity of the electrocardiogram algorithm for detecting arrhythmias was 99.7% (95% confidence intervals, CI: 98.5 to 99.9) and the specificity was 99.5% (95% CI: 98.0 to 99.9) compared to the consensus result created by panel of cardiologists. The sensitivity of the algorithm for the detection of any electrocardiogram anomaly, including abnormal measurements, was 71.3% (95% CI: 65.5 to 76.7) and the specificity was 35.1% (95% CI: 27.0 to 43.8) compared to the panel of cardiologists. Clinical Significance The electrocardiogram algorithm was shown to have high sensitivity for the detection of arrhythmias, but not all electrocardiogram anomalies. The results support the use of this algorithm as a tool to aid in the triage of the electrocardiogram workflow.},

abstract = {The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is currently the most popular method for searching databases of biological sequences. BLAST compares sequences via similarity defined by a weighted edit distance, which results in it being computationally expensive. As opposed to working with edit distance, a vector similarity approach can be accelerated substantially using modern hardware or hashing techniques. Such an approach would require fixed-length embeddings for biological sequences. There has been recent interest in learning fixed-length protein embeddings using deep learning models under the hypothesis that the hidden layers of supervised or semi-supervised models could produce potentially useful vector embeddings. We consider transformer (BERT) protein language models that are pretrained on the TrEMBL data set and learn fixed-length embeddings on top of them with contextual lenses. The embeddings are trained to predict the family a protein belongs to for sequences in the Pfam database. We show that for nearest-neighbor family classification, pretraining offers a noticeable boost in performance and that the corresponding learned embeddings are competitive with BLAST. Furthermore, we show that the raw transformer embeddings, obtained via static pooling, do not perform well on nearest-neighbor family classification, which suggests that learning embeddings in a supervised manner via contextual lenses may be a compute-efficient alternative to fine-tuning.},

The availability of large amount of sequence data, owing to the advancement of novel sequencing technologies, have conceded exciting possibilities for developing suitable AMR exploration tools. However, the level of complexity of bioinformatic analyses has raised as well, since the achievement of desired results involves executing several challenging steps. Here, sraX is proposed as a fully automated analytical pipeline for performing a precise resistome analysis.

Furthermore, sraX also exhibits relevant operational features since the complete analysis is accomplished by executing a single-command step. The capacity and efficacy of sraX was demonstrated by re-analyzing 197 strains belonging to Enterococcus spp., from which we confirmed 99.15% of all detection events that were reported in the original study. sraX can be downloaded from https://github.com/lgpdevtools/srax.},

(eds.), Geo-informatics and Oceanography. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 105, pp. 129–133. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. A method based on data augmentation and transfer learning methods is proposed to address the problems of complicated steps, low accuracy, and poor generalization of traditional aquatic animal image classification methods. First, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network is used to enhance the data of the sample. Second, based on modifying the source model's fully connected classification layer, the weights of high-level convolution modules are set to be trained for adaptive adjustment. Finally, using the accuracy on the validation set and training time as the evaluation indexes, the performance experiments were conducted on various network structures and a different proportion of trainable parameters. The experimental results show that when the portion of trainable parameters is around 75%, the accuracy of the image recognition model obtained by retraining can reach 97.9%, which can be improved by up to 36 percentage points compared with the support vector machine algorithm.},

abstract = {Beta-lactamases (BLs) are enzymes localized in the periplasmic space of bacterial pathogens, where they confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Experimental identification of BLs is costly yet crucial to understand beta-lactam resistance mechanisms. To address this issue, we present DeepBL, a deep learning-based approach by incorporating sequence-derived features to enable high-throughput prediction of BLs. Specifically, DeepBL is implemented based on the Small VGGNet architecture and the TensorFlow deep learning library. Furthermore, the performance of DeepBL models is investigated in relation to the sequence redundancy level and negative sample selection in the benchmark dataset. The models are trained on datasets of varying sequence redundancy thresholds, and the model performance is evaluated by extensive benchmarking tests. Using the optimized DeepBL model, we perform proteome-wide screening for all reviewed bacterium protein sequences available from the UniProt database. These results are freely accessible at the DeepBL webserver at http://deepbl.erc.monash.edu.au/.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been great interest in learning how to best represent proteins, specifically with fixed-length embeddings. Deep learning has become a popular tool for protein representation learning as a model's hidden layers produce potentially useful vector embeddings. TAPE introduced a number of benchmark tasks and showed that semi-supervised learning, via pretraining language models on a large protein corpus, improved performance on downstream tasks. Two of the tasks (fluorescence prediction and stability prediction) involve learning fitness landscapes. In this paper, we show that CNN models trained solely using supervised learning both compete with and sometimes outperform the best models from TAPE that leverage expensive pretraining on large protein datasets. These CNN models are sufficiently simple and small that they can be trained using a Google Colab notebook. We also find for the fluorescence task that linear regression outperforms our models and the TAPE models. The benchmarking tasks proposed by TAPE are excellent measures of a model's ability to predict protein function and should be used going forward. However, we believe it is important to add baselines from simple models to put the performance of the semi-supervised models that have been reported so far into perspective.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is a ubiquitous bacterium that has widely been exposed to antibiotics over the last 70 years. It has adapted by acquiring different antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), which we aim at characterizing the census here. To do so, we analysed 70,301 E. coli genomes obtained from the EnteroBase database and detected 1,027,651 ARG using the AMRFinder, Mustard and ResfinderFG ARG databases. We observed a strong phylogroup/clonal lineage specific distribution of some ARG, arguing for epistasis between ARG and the strain genetic background. However, each phylogroup had ARG conferring a similar resistance pattern, indicating phenotypic convergence. The GC content or the type of ARG was not associated to the frequency of the ARG in the database. Besides, we identified ARG from anaerobic, non-Proteobacteria bacteria in four genomes of E. coli supporting that the transfer between anaerobic bacteria and E. coli can spontaneously occur but remain exceptional. In conclusion, we showed that phylum barrier and intra-species phylogenetic history are major drivers of the acquisition of resistome in E. coli.},

abstract = {Motivation Inferring the properties of a protein from its amino acid sequence is one of the key problems in bioinformatics. Most state-of-the-art approaches for protein classification tasks are tailored to single classification tasks and rely on handcrafted features such as position-specific-scoring matrices from expensive database searches. We argue that this level of performance can be reached or even be surpassed by learning a task-agnostic representation once, using self-supervised language modeling, and transferring it to specific tasks by a simple finetuning step. Results We put forward a universal deep sequence model that is pretrained on unlabeled protein sequences from Swiss-Prot and finetuned on protein classification tasks. We apply it to three prototypical tasks, namely enzyme class prediction, gene ontology prediction and remote homology and fold detection. The proposed method performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms that were tailored to these specific tasks or, for two out of three tasks, even outperforms them. These results stress the possibility of inferring protein properties from the sequence alone and, on more general grounds, the prospects of modern natural language processing methods in omics.

abstract = {LookingGlass is presented, a deep learning model encoding contextually-aware, functionally and evolutionarily relevant representations of short DNA reads, that distinguishes reads of disparate function, homology, and environmental origin. The majority of microbial genomes have yet to be cultured, and most proteins identified in microbial genomes or environmental sequences cannot be functionally annotated. As a result, current computational approaches to describe microbial systems rely on incomplete reference databases that cannot adequately capture the functional diversity of the microbial tree of life, limiting our ability to model high-level features of biological sequences. Here we present LookingGlass, a deep learning model encoding contextually-aware, functionally and evolutionarily relevant representations of short DNA reads, that distinguishes reads of disparate function, homology, and environmental origin. We demonstrate the ability of LookingGlass to be fine-tuned via transfer learning to perform a range of diverse tasks: to identify novel oxidoreductases, to predict enzyme optimal temperature, and to recognize the reading frames of DNA sequence fragments. LookingGlass enables functionally relevant representations of otherwise unknown and unannotated sequences, shedding light on the microbial dark matter that dominates life on Earth.},

abstract = {Microbiomes are complex ecological systems that play crucial roles in understanding natural phenomena from human disease to climate change. Especially in human gut microbiome studies, where collecting clinical samples can be arduous, the number of taxa considered in any one study often exceeds the number of samples ten to one hundred-fold. This discrepancy decreases the power of studies to identify meaningful differences between samples, increases the likelihood of false positive results, and subsequently limits reproducibility. Despite the vast collections of microbiome data already available, biome-specific patterns of microbial structure are not currently leveraged to inform studies. Instead, most microbiome survey studies focus on differential abundance testing per taxa in pursuit of specific biomarkers for a given phenotype. This methodology assumes differences in individual species, genera, or families can be used to distinguish between microbial communities and ignores community-level response. In this paper, we propose to leverage public microbiome databases to shift the analysis paradigm from a focus on taxonomic counts to a focus on comprehensive properties that more completely characterize microbial community members’ function and environmental relationships. We learn these properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxa co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. The resulting set of embeddings transforms human gut microbiome data from thousands of taxa counts to a latent variable landscape of only one hundred “properties”, or contextual relationships. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that these properties can be interpreted in the context of current knowledge; properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways, and distances between taxa in “property space” roughly correlate with their phylogenetic distances. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies. More broadly, this paper explores a reframing of the microbiome analysis mindset, from taxonomic counts to comprehensive community-level properties. By providing a set of pre-trained embeddings, we allow any V4 16S amplicon study to leverage and apply the publicly informed properties presented to increase the statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of analysis.},
