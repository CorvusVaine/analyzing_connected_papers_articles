abstract = {MOTIVATION
Research shows that human microbiome is highly dynamic on longitudinal timescales, changing dynamically with diet, or due to medical interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework "phyLoSTM", using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) for feature extraction and analysis of temporal dependency in longitudinal microbiome sequencing data along with host's environmental factors for disease prediction. Additional novelty in terms of handling variable timepoints in subjects through LSTMs, as well as, weight balancing between imbalanced cases and controls is proposed.


RESULTS
We simulated 100 datasets across multiple time points for model testing. To demonstrate the model's effectiveness, we also implemented this novel method into two real longitudinal human microbiome studies: (i) DIABIMMUNE three country cohort with food allergy outcomes (Milk, Egg, Peanut and Overall) (ii) DiGiulio study with preterm delivery as outcome. Extensive analysis and comparison of our approach yields encouraging performance with an AUC of 0.897 (increased by 5%) on simulated studies and AUCs of 0.762 (increased by 19%) and 0.713 (increased by 8%) on the two real longitudinal microbiome studies respectively, as compared to the next best performing method, Random Forest. The proposed methodology improves predictive accuracy on longitudinal human microbiome studies containing spatially correlated data, and evaluates the change of microbiome composition contributing to outcome prediction.

abstract = {Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X-30X speedup over the basic approach.

abstract = {Current microbial source tracking techniques that rely on grab samples analyzed by individual endpoint assays are inadequate to explain microbial sources across space and time. Modeling and predicting host sources of microbial contamination could add a useful tool for watershed management. In this study, we tested and evaluated machine learning models to predict the major sources of microbial contamination in a watershed. We examined the relationship between microbial sources, land cover, weather, and hydrologic variables in a watershed in Northern California, United States. Six models, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, Support vector machine (SVM), simple neural network (NN), Random Forest, and XGBoost, were built to predict major microbial sources using land cover, weather and hydrologic variables. The results showed that these models successfully predicted microbial sources classified into two categories (human and non-human), with the average accuracy ranging from 69% (Naïve Bayes) to 88% (XGBoost). The area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) illustrated XGBoost had the best performance (average AUC = 0.88), followed by Random Forest (average AUC = 0.84), and KNN (average AUC = 0.74). The importance index obtained from Random Forest indicated that precipitation and temperature were the two most important factors to predict the dominant microbial source. These results suggest that machine learning models, particularly XGBoost, can predict the dominant sources of microbial contamination based on the relationship of microbial contaminants with daily weather and land cover, providing a powerful tool to understand microbial sources in water.},

abstract = {Abstract With the rapid accumulation of microbiome data around the world, numerous computational bioinformatics methods have been developed for pattern mining from such paramount microbiome data. Current microbiome data mining methods, such as gene and species mining, rely heavily on sequence comparison. Most of these methods, however, have a clear trade-off, particularly, when it comes to big-data analytical efficiency and accuracy. Microbiome entities are usually organized in ontology structures, and pattern mining methods that have considered ontology structures could offer advantages in mining efficiency and accuracy. Here, we have summarized the ontology-aware neural network (ONN) as a novel framework for microbiome data mining. We have discussed the applications of ONN in multiple contexts, including gene mining, species mining and microbial community dynamic pattern mining. We have then highlighted one of the most important characteristics of ONN, namely, novel knowledge discovery, which makes ONN a standout among all microbiome data mining methods. Finally, we have provided several applications to showcase the advantage of ONN over other methods in microbiome data mining. In summary, ONN represents a paradigm shift for pattern mining from microbiome data: from traditional machine learning approach to ontology-aware and model-based approach, which has found its broad application scenarios in microbiome data mining.},

The transmission of the signal of these alterations to distant sites through protein motion results in changes in protein expression and cell function. The detection of residues involved in signal transmission contributes to an elucidation of the mechanisms underlying processes as vast as cellular function and disease pathogenesis. We developed an autoencoder (AE) based method that detects residues essential for signaling by comparing the fluctuation data, particularly the time fluctuation of the side-chain distances between residues, during molecular dynamics simulations between the ligand-bound and -unbound forms or wild-type and mutant forms of proteins. Here, the AE-based method was applied to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) system, particularly a class A-type GPCR, CXCR4, to detect the essential residues involved in signaling. Among the residues involved in the signaling of the homolog CXCR2, which were extracted from the literature based on the complex structures of the ligand and G protein, our method could detect more than half of the essential residues involved in G protein signaling, including those spanning the fifth and sixth transmembrane helices in the intracellular region, despite the lack of information regarding the interaction with G protein in our CXCR4 models.},

abstract = {Antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins to T-cell receptors (TCRs) plays a crucial role in triggering the adaptive immune response. Most of our knowledge on TCR-peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) interaction stemmed from experiments yielding static structures, yet the dynamic aspects of this molecular interaction are equally important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and to develop treatment strategies against diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. To this end, computational biophysics studies including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have provided useful insights; however, we still lack a basic understanding of an overall allosteric mechanism that results in conformational changes in the TCR and subsequent T-cell activation. Previous hydrogen-deuterium exchange and nuclear magnetic resonance studies provided clues regarding these molecular mechanisms, including global rigidification and allosteric effects on the constant domain of TCRs away from the pMHC interaction site. Here, we show that molecular dynamics simulations can be used to identify how this overall rigidification may be related to the allosteric communication within TCRs upon pMHC interaction via essential dynamics and nonbonded residue-residue interaction energy analyses. The residues taking part in the rigidification effect are highlighted with an intricate analysis on residue interaction changes, which lead to a detailed outline of the complex formation event. Our results indicate that residues of the Cβ domain of TCRs show significant differences in their nonbonded interactions upon complex formation. Moreover, the dynamic cross correlations between these residues are also increased, in line with their nonbonded interaction energy changes. Altogether, our approach may be valuable for elucidating intramolecular allosteric changes in the TCR structure upon pMHC interaction in molecular dynamics simulations.},

Current methods are suitable mainly for the discovery of close homologous ARGs and have limited utility for discovery of novel ARGs, thus rendering the profiling of ARGs incomprehensive. Here, an ontology-aware deep learning model, ONN4ARG (http://onn4arg.xfcui.com/), is proposed for the discovery of novel ARGs based on multi-level annotations. Experiments based on billions of candidate microbial genes collected from various environments show the superiority of ONN4ARG in comprehensive ARG profiling. Enrichment analyses show that ARGs are both environment-specific and host-specific. For example, resistance genes for rifamycin, which is an important antibacterial agent active against gram-positive bacteria, are enriched in Actinobacteria and in soil environment. Case studies verified ONN4ARG’s ability for novel ARG discovery. For example, a novel streptomycin resistance gene was discovered from oral microbiome samples and validated through wet-lab experiments. ONN4ARG provides a complete picture of the prevalence of ARGs in microbial communities as well as guidance for detection and reduction of the spread of resistance genes.},

 Numerous pieces of clinical evidence have shown that many phenotypic traits of human disease are related to their gut microbiome. Through supervised classification, it is feasible to determine the human disease states by revealing the intestinal microbiota compositional information. However, the abundance matrix of microbiome data is so sparse, an interpretable deep model is crucial to further represent and mine the data for expansion, such as the deep forest. What's more, overfitting can still exist in the original deep forest model when dealing with such “large p, small n” biology data. Feature reduction is considered to improve the ensemble forest model especially towards the disease identification in the human microbiota. In this work, we propose the kernel principal components based cascade forest method, so-called KPCCF, to classify the disease states of patients by using taxonomic profiles of the microbiome at the family level. In detail, the kernel principal components analysis method is first used to reduce the original dimension of human microbiota datasets. Besides, the processed data is fed into the cascade forest to preliminarily discriminate the disease state of the samples. Thus, the proposed KPCCF algorithm can represent the small-scale and high-dimension human microbiota datasets with the sparse feature matrix. Systematic comparison experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with the comparative study on 4 datasets. Additionally, compared to other dimensionality reduction methods, kernel principal components analysis method is more suitable for microbiota datasets.},

Moreover, existing source tracking methods could not extend well for source tracking samples from understudied biomes, as well as samples from longitudinal studies. Here, we introduce EXPERT (https://github.com/HUST-NingKang-Lab/EXPERT), an exact and pervasive expert model for source tracking microbial communities based on transfer learning. Built upon the biome ontology information and transfer learning techniques, EXPERT has acquired the context-aware flexibility and could easily expand the supervised model’s search scope to include the context-dependent community samples and understudied biomes. While at the same time, it is superior to current approaches in source tracking accuracy and speed. EXPERT’s superiority has been demonstrated on multiple source tracking tasks, including source tracking samples collected at different disease stages and longitudinal samples. For example, when dealing with 635 samples from a recent study of colorectal cancer, EXPERT could achieve an AUROC of 0.977 when predicting the host’s phenotypical status. In summary, EXPERT has unleashed the potential of model-based source tracking approaches, enabling source tracking in versatile context-dependent settings, accomplishing pervasive and in-depth knowledge discovery from microbiome.},

Our approach takes an input format of a 2D matrix representing the phylogenetic tree populated with the relative abundance of microbial taxa in a metagenomic sample. This conversion empowers CNNs to explore the spatial relationship of the taxonomic annotations on the tree and their quantitative characteristics in metagenomic data. We show the competitiveness of our model compared to other available methods using nine metagenomic datasets of moderate size for binary classification. With synthetic and biological datasets, we show the superior and robust performance of our model for multi-class classification.

abstract = {Dynamic allostery on proteins, triggered by regulator binding or chemical modifications, transmits information from the binding site to distant regions, dramatically altering protein function. It is accompanied by subtle changes in side-chain conformations of the protein, indicating that the changes in dynamics, and not rigid or large conformational changes, are essential to understand regulation of protein function. Although a lot of experimental and theoretical studies have been dedicated to investigate this issue, the regulation mechanism of protein function is still debate. Here, we propose an autoencoder-based method that can detect dynamic allostery. The method is based on the comparison of time fluctuations of protein structures, in the form of distance matrices, obtained from molecular dynamics simulations in ligand-bound and -unbound forms. Our method detected that the changes in dynamics by ligand binding in the PDZ2 domain led to the reorganization of correlative fluctuation motions among residue pairs, which revealed a different view of the correlated motions from the PCA and DCCM. In addition, other correlative motions were also found as a result of the dynamic perturbation from the ligand binding, which may lead to dynamic allostery. This autoencoder-based method would be usefully applied to the signal transduction and mutagenesis systems involved in protein functions and severe diseases.},

An increasing number of longitudinal microbiome studies, which record time to disease onset, aim to identify candidate microbes as biomarkers for prognosis. Owing to the ultra-skewness and sparsity of microbiome proportion (relative abundance) data, directly applying traditional statistical methods may result in substantial power loss or spurious inferences. We propose a novel joint modeling framework [JointMM], which is comprised of two sub-models: a longitudinal sub-model called zero-inflated scaled-Beta generalized linear mixed-effects regression to depict the temporal structure of microbial proportions among subjects; and a survival sub-model to characterize the occurrence of an event and its relationship with the longitudinal microbiome proportions. JointMM is specifically designed to handle the zero-inflated and highly skewed longitudinal microbial proportion data and examine whether the temporal pattern of microbial presence and/or the non-zero microbial proportions are associated with differences in the time to an event. The longitudinal sub-model of JointMM also provides the capacity to investigate how the (time-varying) covariates are related to the temporal microbial presence/absence patterns and/or the changing trend in non-zero proportions. Comprehensive simulations and real data analyses are used to assess the statistical efficiency and interpretability of JointMM.},

abstract = {Background The spread of antibiotic resistance has become one of the most urgent threats to global health, which is estimated to cause 700,000 deaths each year globally. Its surrogates, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), are highly transmittable between food, water, animal, and human to mitigate the efficacy of antibiotics. Accurately identifying ARGs is thus an indispensable step to understanding the ecology, and transmission of ARGs between environmental and human-associated reservoirs. Unfortunately, the previous computational methods for identifying ARGs are mostly based on sequence alignment, which cannot identify novel ARGs, and their applications are limited by currently incomplete knowledge about ARGs. Results Here, we propose an end-to-end Hierarchical Multi-task Deep learning framework for ARG annotation (HMD-ARG). Taking raw sequence encoding as input, HMD-ARG can identify, without querying against existing sequence databases, multiple ARG properties simultaneously, including if the input protein sequence is an ARG, and if so, what antibiotic family it is resistant to, what resistant mechanism the ARG takes, and if the ARG is an intrinsic one or acquired one. In addition, if the predicted antibiotic family is beta-lactamase, HMD-ARG further predicts the subclass of beta-lactamase that the ARG is resistant to. Comprehensive experiments, including cross-fold validation, third-party dataset validation in human gut microbiota, wet-experimental functional validation, and structural investigation of predicted conserved sites, demonstrate not only the superior performance of our method over the state-of-art methods, but also the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Conclusions We propose a hierarchical multi-task method, HMD-ARG, which is based on deep learning and can provide detailed annotations of ARGs from three important aspects: resistant antibiotic class, resistant mechanism, and gene mobility. We believe that HMD-ARG can serve as a powerful tool to identify antibiotic resistance genes and, therefore mitigate their global threat.

abstract = {With the rapid increase in sequencing data, human host status inference (e.g. healthy or sick) from microbiome data has become an important issue. Existing studies are mostly based on single-point microbiome composition, while it is rare that the host status is predicted from longitudinal microbiome data. However, single-point-based methods cannot capture the dynamic patterns between the temporal changes and host status. Therefore, it remains challenging to build good predictive models as well as scaling to different microbiome contexts. On the other hand, existing methods are mainly targeted for disease prediction and seldom investigate other host statuses. To fill the gap, we propose a comprehensive deep learning-based framework that utilizes longitudinal microbiome data as input to infer the human host status. Specifically, the framework is composed of specific data preparation strategies and a recurrent neural network tailored for longitudinal microbiome data. In experiments, we evaluated the proposed method on both semi-synthetic and real datasets based on different sequencing technologies and metagenomic contexts. The results indicate that our method achieves robust performance compared to other baseline and state-of-the-art classifiers and provides a significant reduction in prediction time.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the functional tensor singular value decomposition (FTSVD), a novel dimension reduction framework for tensors with one functional mode and several tabular modes. The problem is motivated by high-order longitudinal data analysis. Our model assumes the observed data to be a random realization of an approximate CP low-rank functional tensor measured on a discrete time grid. Incorporating tensor algebra and the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), we propose a novel RKHS-based constrained power iteration with spectral initialization. Our method can successfully estimate both singular vectors and functions of the low-rank structure in the observed data. With mild assumptions, we establish the non-asymptotic contractive error bounds for the proposed algorithm. The superiority of the proposed framework is demonstrated via extensive experiments on both simulated and real data.},

abstract = {Abstract Motivation Research supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of some diseases. Motivated by the findings that microbiome data is complex in nature, and there is an inherent correlation due to hierarchical taxonomy of microbial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), we propose a novel machine learning method incorporating a stratified approach to group OTUs into phylum clusters. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used to train within each of the clusters individually. Further, through an ensemble learning approach, features obtained from each cluster were then concatenated to improve prediction accuracy. Our two-step approach comprising stratification prior to combining multiple CNNs, aided in capturing the relationships between OTUs sharing a phylum efficiently, as compared to using a single CNN ignoring OTU correlations. Results We used simulated datasets containing 168 OTUs in 200 cases and 200 controls for model testing. Thirty-two OTUs, potentially associated with risk of disease were randomly selected and interactions between three OTUs were used to introduce non-linearity. We also implemented this novel method in two human microbiome studies: (i) Cirrhosis with 118 cases, 114 controls; (ii) type 2 diabetes (T2D) with 170 cases, 174 controls; to demonstrate the model’s effectiveness. Extensive experimentation and comparison against conventional machine learning techniques yielded encouraging results. We obtained mean AUC values of 0.88, 0.92, 0.75, showing a consistent increment (5%, 3%, 7%) in simulations, Cirrhosis and T2D data, respectively, against the next best performing method, Random Forest.

Current methods face challenges when the number of samples and niches are magnitudes more than current in use, under which circumstances they are unable to accurately source track samples in a timely manner, rendering them difficult in knowledge discovery from sub-million heterogeneous samples. Here, we introduce a deep learning method based on Ontology-aware Neural Network approach, ONN4MST (https://github.com/HUST-NingKang-Lab/ONN4MST), which takes into consideration the ontology structure of niches and the relationship of samples from these ontologically-organized niches. ONN4MST’s superiority in accuracy, speed and robustness have been proven, for example with an accuracy of 0.99 and AUC of 0.97 in a microbial source tracking experiment that 125,823 samples and 114 niches were involved. Moreover, ONN4MST has been utilized on several source tracking applications, showing that it could provide highly-interpretable results from samples with previously less-studied niches, detect microbial contaminants, and identify similar samples from ontologically-remote niches, with high fidelity.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, researchers have uncovered endless ways in which microbiota are associated with host health and behaviour. The microbiota throughout the body – gut, oral cavity, nasal cavity, skin, vagina – all function in a delicate balance aiding in digestion, pathogen deterrence and general host homeostasis. Microbial dysbiosis (a shift away from a balanced composition) is also implicated in a number of conditions and diseases ranging from obesity (Turnbaugh and Gordon, 2009; Ley, 2010) to inflammatory bowel diseases (Spor et al., 2011; van der Giessen et al., 2020) to autoimmune diseases (Shamriz et al., 2016; Neuman and Koren, 2017) to behavioural and mental health disorders, such as stress (Werbner et al., 2019) and Alzheimer’s disease (Cryan et al., 2020). There is constant bi-directional communication between the microbiota and the host, and the microbiota both drives health complications in the host and responds to them. Thus, the microbiome already does and will continue to play a role in health and healthcare best practices. In this perspective, we highlight the anticipated role of the microbiome and microbiome-driven applications in modern medicine.},

abstract = {Longitudinal microbiome studies have been widely used to unveil the dynamics in the complex host-microbial ecosystems. Modeling the longitudinal microbiome compositional data, which is semi-continuous in nature, is challenging in several aspects: the overabundance of zeros, the heavy skewness of non-zero values that are bounded in (0, 1), and the dependence between the binary and non-zero parts. To deal with these challenges, we first extended the work of Chen and Li [1] and proposed a two-part zero-inflated Beta regression model with shared random effects (ZIBR-SRE), which characterize the dependence between the binary and the continuous parts. Besides, the microbiome compositional data have unit-sum constraint, indicating the existence of negative correlations among taxa. As ZIBR-SRE models each taxon separately, it does not satisfy the sum-to-one constraint. We then proposed a two-part linear mixed model (TPLMM) with shared random effects to formulate the log-transformed standardized relative abundances rather than the original ones. Such transformation is called “additive logistic transformation”, initially developed for cross-sectional compositional data. We extended it to analyze the longitudinal microbiome compositions and showed that the unit-sum constraint can be automatically satisfied under the TPLMM framework. Model performances of TPLMM and ZIBR-SRE were compared with existing methods in simulation studies. Under settings adopted from real data, TPLMM had the best performance and is recommended for practical use. An oral microbiome application further showed that TPLMM and ZIBR-SRE estimated a strong correlation structure in the binary and the continuous parts, suggesting models without accounting for this dependence would lead to biased inferences.},

We applied this method to a wide range of graph classification problems, and show that when using a self regularized activation function, QGCN outperforms the state of the art methods for all graph classification tasks tested with or without external input on each graph.

CARD focuses on providing high-quality reference data and molecular sequences within a controlled vocabulary, the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), designed by the CARD biocuration team to integrate with software development efforts for resistome analysis and prediction, such as CARD’s Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software. Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes & Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants. Here, we describe updates and recent expansions to CARD and its biocuration process, including new resources for community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.},

abstract = {Metaproteomics is becoming widely used in microbiome research for gaining insights into the functional state of the microbial community. Current metaproteomics studies are generally based on high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled with liquid chromatography. In this paper, we proposed a deep-learning-based algorithm, named DeepFilter, for improving peptide identifications from a collection of tandem mass spectra. The key advantage of the DeepFilter is that it does not need ad hoc training or fine-tuning as in existing filtering tools. DeepFilter is freely available under the GNU GPL license at https://github.com/Biocomputing-Research-Group/DeepFilter. SIGNIFICANCE: The identification of peptides and proteins from MS data involves the computational procedure of searching MS/MS spectra against a predefined protein sequence database and assigning top-scored peptides to spectra. Existing computational tools are still far from being able to extract all the information out of MS/MS data sets acquired from metaproteome samples. Systematical experiment results demonstrate that the DeepFilter identified up to 12% and 9% more peptide-spectrum-matches and proteins, respectively, compared with existing filtering algorithms, including Percolator, Q-ranker, PeptideProphet, and iProphet, on marine and soil microbial metaproteome samples with false discovery rate at 1%. The taxonomic analysis shows that DeepFilter found up to 7%, 10%, and 14% more species from marine, soil, and human gut samples compared with existing filtering algorithms. Therefore, DeepFilter was believed to generalize properly to new, previously unseen peptide-spectrum-matches and can be readily applied in peptide identification from metaproteomics data.},

Here, we propose as a solution a search-based microbiome transition network. ABSTRACT Microbiomes are inherently linked by their structural similarity, yet the global features of such similarity are not clear. Here, we propose as a solution a search-based microbiome transition network. By traversing a composition-similarity-based network of 177,022 microbiomes, we show that although the compositions are distinct by habitat, each microbiome is on-average only seven neighbors from any other microbiome on Earth, indicating the inherent homology of microbiomes at the global scale. This network is scale-free, suggesting a high degree of stability and robustness in microbiome transition. By tracking the minimum spanning tree in this network, a global roadmap of microbiome dispersal was derived that tracks the potential paths of formulating and propagating microbiome diversity. Such search-based global microbiome networks, reconstructed within hours on just one computing node, provide a readily expanded reference for tracing the origin and evolution of existing or new microbiomes. IMPORTANCE It remains unclear whether and how compositional changes at the "community to community" level among microbiomes are linked to the origin and evolution of global microbiome diversity. Here we propose a microbiome transition model and a network-based analysis framework to describe and simulate the variation and dispersal of the global microbial beta-diversity across multiple habitats. The traversal of a transition network with 177,022 samples shows the inherent homology of microbiome at the global scale. Then a global roadmap of microbiome dispersal derived from the network tracks the potential paths of formulating and propagating microbiome diversity. Such search-based microbiome network provides a readily expanded reference for tracing the origin and evolution of existing or new microbiomes at the global scale.},

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities influence their environment by modifying the availability of compounds such as nutrients or chemical elicitors. Knowing the microbial composition of a site is therefore relevant to improving productivity or health. However, sequencing facilities are not always available, or may be prohibitively expensive in some cases. Thus, it would be desirable to computationally predict the microbial composition from more accessible, easily-measured features. Results Integrating Deep Learning techniques with microbiome data, we propose an artificial neural network architecture based on heterogeneous autoencoders to condense the long vector of microbial abundance values into a deep latent space representation. Then, we design a model to predict the deep latent space and, consequently, to predict the complete microbial composition using environmental features as input. The performance of our system is examined using the rhizosphere microbiome of Maize. We reconstruct the microbial composition (717 taxa) from the deep latent space (10 values) with high fidelity (¿0.9 Pearson correlation). We then successfully predict microbial composition from environmental variables such as plant age, temperature or precipitation (0.73 Pearson correlation, 0.42 Bray-Curtis). We extend this to predict microbiome composition under hypothetical scenarios, such as future climate change conditions. Finally, via transfer learning, we predict microbial composition in a distinct scenario with only a hundred sequences, and distinct environmental features. We propose that our deep latent space may assist microbiome-engineering strategies when technical or financial resources are limited, through predicting current or future microbiome compositions.

abstract = {The human microbiome plays a number of critical roles, impacting almost every aspect of human health and well-being. Conditions in the microbiome have been linked to a number of significant diseases. Additionally, revolutions in sequencing technology have led to a rapid increase in publicly-available sequencing data. Consequently, there have been growing efforts to predict disease status from metagenomic sequencing data, with a proliferation of new approaches in the last few years. Some of these efforts have explored utilizing a powerful form of machine learning called deep learning, which has been applied successfully in several biological domains. Here, we review some of these methods and the algorithms that they are based on, with a particular focus on deep learning methods. We also perform a deeper analysis of Type 2 Diabetes and obesity datasets that have eluded improved results, using a variety of machine learning and feature extraction methods. We conclude by offering perspectives on study design considerations that may impact results and future directions the field can take to improve results and offer more valuable conclusions.

abstract = {The microbiome-wide association studies are to figure out the relationship between microorganisms and humans, with the goal of discovering relevant biomarkers to guide disease diagnosis. However, the microbiome data is complex, with high noise and dimensions. Traditional machine learning methods are limited by the models' representation ability and cannot learn complex patterns from the data. Recently, deep learning has been widely applied to fields ranging from text processing to image recognition due to its efficient flexibility and high capacity. But the deep learning models must be trained with enough data in order to achieve good performance, which is impractical in reality. In addition, deep learning is considered as black box and hard to interpret. These factors make deep learning not widely used in microbiome-wide association studies. In this work, we construct a sparse microbial interaction network and embed this graph into deep model to alleviate the risk of overfitting and improve the performance. Further, we explore a Graph Embedding Deep Feedforward Network (GEDFN) to conduct feature selection and guide meaningful microbial markers' identification. Based on the experimental results, we verify the feasibility of combining the microbial graph model with the deep learning model, and demonstrate the feasibility of applying deep learning and feature selection on microbial data. Our main contributions are: firstly, we utilize different methods to construct a variety of microbial interaction networks and combine the network via graph embedding deep learning. Secondly, we introduce a feature selection method based on graph embedding and validate the biological meaning of microbial markers. The code is available at https://github.com/MicroAVA/GEDFN.git.},

abstract = {Food allergy is usually difficult to diagnose in early life, and the inability to diagnose patients with atopic diseases at an early age may lead to severe complications. Numerous studies have suggested an association between the infant gut microbiome and development of allergy. In this work, we investigated the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict food allergies in early life (0-3 years) from subjects’ longitudinal gut microbiome profiles. Using the DIABIMMUNE dataset, we show an increase in predictive power using our model compared to Hidden Markov Model, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and LASSO regression. We further evaluated whether the training of LSTM networks benefits from reduced representations of microbial features. We considered sparse autoencoder for extraction of potential latent representations in addition to standard feature selection procedures based on Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and variance prior to the training of LSTM networks. The comprehensive evaluation reveals that LSTM networks with the mRMR selected features achieve significantly better performance compared to the other tested machine learning models.},

abstract = {Motivation Microbial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of various biosystems, ranging from the human body to the environment. A major challenge in microbiome research is the classification of microbial communities of different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine, agriculture, and forensic science. We describe a reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting environments and host phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for investigating the sufficiency of shallow sub-samples. Deep learning methods as well as classical approaches were explored for predicting environments and host phenotypes. Results k-mer distribution of shallow sub-samples outperformed the computationally costly Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in the tasks of body-site identification and Crohn's disease prediction. Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow sub-samples allows (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required in OTU-picking, and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological environments, and 5 organismal environments with high macro-F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.87. For large datasets, deep learning outperformed classical methods such as Random Forest and SVM. Availability The software and datasets are available at https://llp.berkeley.edu/micropheno.},
