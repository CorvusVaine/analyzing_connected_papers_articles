abstract = {This work introduces SemiBin, an open source tool that uses deep siamese neural networks to implement a semi-supervised approach to binning, i.e. exploits the information in reference genomes, while retaining the capability of reconstructing high-quality bins that are outside the reference dataset. Metagenomic binning is the step in building metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) when sequences predicted to originate from the same genome are automatically grouped together. The most widely-used methods for binning are reference-independent, operating de novo and enable the recovery of genomes from previously unsampled clades. However, they do not leverage the knowledge in existing databases. Here, we introduce SemiBin, an open source tool that uses deep siamese neural networks to implement a semi-supervised approach, i.e. SemiBin exploits the information in reference genomes, while retaining the capability of reconstructing high-quality bins that are outside the reference dataset. Using simulated and real microbiome datasets from several different habitats from GMGCv1 (Global Microbial Gene Catalog), including the human gut, non-human guts, and environmental habitats (ocean and soil), we show that SemiBin outperforms existing state-of-the-art binning methods. In particular, compared to other methods, SemiBin returns more high-quality bins with larger taxonomic diversity, including more distinct genera and species.},

abstract = {Abstract Motivation Microbial gene catalogs are data structures that organize genes found in microbial communities, providing a reference for standardized analysis of the microbes across samples and studies. Although gene catalogs are commonly used, they have not been critically evaluated for their effectiveness as a basis for metagenomic analyses. Results As a case study, we investigate one such catalog, the Integrated Gene Catalog (IGC), however, our observations apply broadly to most gene catalogs constructed to date. We focus on both the approach used to construct this catalog and on its effectiveness when used as a reference for microbiome studies. Our results highlight important limitations of the approach used to construct the IGC and call into question the broad usefulness of gene catalogs more generally. We also recommend best practices for the construction and use of gene catalogs in microbiome studies and highlight opportunities for future research.

We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species, expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.},

abstract = {Drinking water contains phylogenetic diverse groups of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that affect the esthetic quality of water, water infrastructure, and public health. Taxonomic, metabolic, and ecological inferences of the drinking water microbiome depend on the accuracy, quality, and completeness of genomes that are reconstructed through the application of genome-resolved metagenomics. ABSTRACT Reconstructing microbial genomes from metagenomic short-read data can be challenging due to the unknown and uneven complexity of microbial communities. This complexity encompasses highly diverse populations, which often includes strain variants. Reconstructing high-quality genomes is a crucial part of the metagenomic workflow, as subsequent ecological and metabolic inferences depend on their accuracy, quality, and completeness. In contrast to microbial communities in other ecosystems, there has been no systematic assessment of genome-centric metagenomic workflows for drinking water microbiomes. In this study, we assessed the performance of a combination of assembly and binning strategies for time series drinking water metagenomes that were collected over 6 months. The goal of this study was to identify the combination of assembly and binning approaches that result in high-quality and -quantity metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), representing most of the sequenced metagenome. Our findings suggest that the metaSPAdes coassembly strategies had the best performance, as they resulted in larger and less fragmented assemblies, with at least 85% of the sequence data mapping to contigs greater than 1 kbp. Furthermore, a combination of metaSPAdes coassembly strategies and MetaBAT2 produced the highest number of medium-quality MAGs while capturing at least 70% of the metagenomes based on read recruitment. Utilizing different assembly/binning approaches also assists in the reconstruction of unique MAGs from closely related species that would have otherwise collapsed into a single MAG using a single workflow. Overall, our study suggests that leveraging multiple binning approaches with different metaSPAdes coassembly strategies may be required to maximize the recovery of good-quality MAGs. IMPORTANCE Drinking water contains phylogenetic diverse groups of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that affect the esthetic quality of water, water infrastructure, and public health. Taxonomic, metabolic, and ecological inferences of the drinking water microbiome depend on the accuracy, quality, and completeness of genomes that are reconstructed through the application of genome-resolved metagenomics. Using time series metagenomic data, we present reproducible genome-centric metagenomic workflows that result in high-quality and -quantity genomes, which more accurately signifies the sequenced drinking water microbiome. These genome-centric metagenomic workflows will allow for improved taxonomic and functional potential analysis that offers enhanced insights into the stability and dynamics of drinking water microbial communities.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of microbial genomes from large metagenomic datasets is a critical procedure for finding uncultivated microbial populations and defining their microbial functional roles. To achieve that, we need to perform metagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes. Despite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important property of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the metagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep Contrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can efficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and robust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add simulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to produce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the distorted data. Consequently, the trained model will be robust to noise and handle it implicitly during usage. CLMB outperforms the previous state-of-the-art binning methods significantly, recovering the most near-complete genomes on almost all the benchmarking datasets (up to 17% more reconstructed genomes compared to the second-best method). It also improves the performance of bin refinement, reconstructing 8-22 more high-quality genomes and 15-32 more middle-quality genomes than the second-best result. Impressively, in addition to being compatible with the binning refiner, single CLMB even recovers on average 15 more HQ genomes than the refiner of VAMB and Maxbin on the benchmarking datasets. On a real mother-infant microbiome dataset with 110 samples, CLMB is scalable and practical to recover 365 high-quality and middle-quality genomes (including 21 new ones), providing insights into the microbiome transmission.

Fourth, these sequence clusters, or bins, undergo rounds of quality assessment and refinement to yield MAGs. The optional fifth stage is dereplication of MAGs to select representatives. Next, each MAG is taxonomically classified. The optional seventh stage is assessing the fraction of diversity that has been recovered. The output of this protocol is draft genomes, which can provide invaluable clues about uncultured organisms.

abstract = {Abstract The human gut microbiota performs functions that are essential for the maintenance of the host physiology. However, characterizing the functioning of microbial communities in relation to the host remains challenging in reference-based metagenomic analyses. Indeed, as taxonomic and functional analyses are performed independently, the link between genes and species remains unclear. Although a first set of species-level bins was built by clustering co-abundant genes, no reference bin set is established on the most used gut microbiota catalog, the Integrated Gene Catalog (IGC). With the aim to identify the best suitable method to group the IGC genes, we benchmarked nine taxonomy-independent binners implementing abundance-based, hybrid and integrative approaches. To this purpose, we designed a simulated non-redundant gene catalog (SGC) and computed adapted assessment metrics. Overall, the best trade-off between the main metrics is reached by an integrative binner. For each approach, we then compared the results of the best-performing binner with our expected community structures and applied the method to the IGC. The three approaches are distinguished by specific advantages, and by inherent or scalability limitations. Hybrid and integrative binners show promising and potentially complementary results but require improvements to be used on the IGC to recover human gut microbial species.},

abstract = {Mouse models are essential for biomedical science and drug discovery, yet it is not known how the bacteria in the mouse microbiota – important determinants of phenotypes of health and disease –affect their relevance to human disease. To interrogate the taxonomic and functional differences between the human and mouse gut microbiotas, we developed the Mouse Microbial Genome Collection (MMGC), a compilation of 276 genomes from cultured isolates and 45,218 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 1,960 publicly available mouse metagenomes. The MMGC reveals that while only 2.65% of bacterial species are shared between mouse and human, over 80% of annotatable functions are present in both microbiomes. Using drug metabolism and butyrate synthesis as examples, we illustrate that although the species harbouring these key functions can differ between hosts, the MMGC enables identification of functionally equivalent taxa in the mouse and human microbiotas. The MMGC thereby facilitates the informed use of mice in biomedical research by providing access to the conservation and taxonomic locations of bacterial functions of interest.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in metagenomic binning, reconstruction of microbial species from metagenomics data remains challenging. Here we develop variational autoencoders for metagenomic binning (VAMB), a program that uses deep variational autoencoders to encode sequence coabundance and k -mer distribution information before clustering. We show that a variational autoencoder is able to integrate these two distinct data types without any previous knowledge of the datasets. VAMB outperforms existing state-of-the-art binners, reconstructing 29–98% and 45% more near-complete (NC) genomes on simulated and real data, respectively. Furthermore, VAMB is able to separate closely related strains up to 99.5% average nucleotide identity (ANI), and reconstructed 255 and 91 NC Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei sample-specific genomes as two distinct clusters from a dataset of 1,000 human gut microbiome samples. We use 2,606 NC bins from this dataset to show that species of the human gut microbiome have different geographical distribution patterns. VAMB can be run on standard hardware and is freely available at https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb . Metagenomics data are resolved into their constituent genomes using a new deep learning method.},

Twelve SGBs are globally spread in the human gut and show different genomic potential in the utilization of complex polysaccharides, suggesting that higher SGB diversity may be related with increased utilization of plant-based foods. Moreover, up to 11 different species may co-occur in the same subject, with lower diversity in Western populations, as well as intestinal inflammatory states and obesity.

The newly assembled genomes were enriched for members of the Bacteroidaceae family, including species associated with high-fiber and seaweed-rich diet. Single-nucleotide variant density was positively associated with the speciation rate of gut commensals. Ultra-deep sequencing facilitated the assembly of genomes of low-abundance taxa, and deep sequencing (>20 million read pairs) was needed for the profiling of low-abundance taxa. Importantly, the HRGM greatly improved the taxonomic and functional classification of sequencing reads from fecal samples. Finally, mapping homologous sequences for human auto-antigens onto the HRGM genomes revealed the association of commensal bacteria with high cross-reactivity potential with autoimmunity. The HRGM (www.mbiomenet.org/HRGM/) will facilitate the identification and functional analysis of disease-associated gut microbiota.},

However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000–2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.},

We thus developed a database‐free method, MaxBin 2.0, to aid in the process of recovering microbial genomes from metagenomes in a de novo manner. The recovery of individual genomes allows analysis of the microbiome in terms of a collection of microbial genomes so that one can understand the functional roles of each species. The data of individual microbes may then be analyzed collectively to untangle the interactions between different microbial organisms. By reporting the genome abundance information for co‐assembled metagenomes, one may also identify which microorganisms dominate the microbiome and which species may co‐occur from the MaxBin 2.0 results. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

Metagenome-Assembled Genomes Orchestra (MAGO) is a computational framework that integrates and simplifies metagenome assembly, binning, bin improvement, bin quality (completeness and contamination), bin annotation, and evolutionary placement of bins via detailed maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on multiple marker genes using different amino acid substitution models, next to average nucleotide identity analysis of genomes for delineation of species boundaries and operational taxonomic units. MAGO offers streamlined execution of the entire metagenomics pipeline, error checking, computational resource distribution and compatibility of data formats, governed by user-tailored pipeline processing. MAGO is an open-source-software package released in three different ways, as a singularity image and a Docker container for HPC purposes as well as for running MAGO on a commodity hardware, and a virtual machine for gaining a full access to MAGO underlying structure and source code. MAGO is open to suggestions for extensions and is amenable for use in both research and teaching of genomics and molecular evolution of genomes assembled from small single-cell projects or large-scale and complex environmental metagenomes.},

The small fraction of genes found in multiple habitats is enriched in antibiotic-resistance genes and markers for mobile genetic elements. By further clustering these species-level genes into 32 million protein families, we observed that a small fraction of these families contain the majority of the genes (0.6% of families account for 50% of the genes). The majority of species-level genes and protein families are rare. Furthermore, species-level genes, and in particular the rare ones, show low rates of positive (adaptive) selection, supporting a model in which most genetic variability observed within each protein family is neutral or nearly neutral.},

abstract = {Background Clustering the metagenomic contigs into potential genomes is a key step to investigate the functional roles of microbial populations. Existing algorithms have achieved considerable success with simulated or real sequencing datasets. However, accurately classifying contigs from complex metagenomes is still a challenge. Results We introduced a novel clustering algorithm, MetaDecoder, which can classify metagenomic contigs based on the frequencies of k -mers and coverages. MetaDecoder was built as a two-layer model with the first layer being a GPU-based modified Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM), which controls the weight of each DPGMM cluster to avoid over-segmentation by dynamically dissolving contigs in small clusters and reassigning them to the remaining clusters. The second layer comprises a semi-supervised k -mer frequency probabilistic model and a modified Gaussian mixture model for modeling the coverage based on single copy marker genes. Benchmarks on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that MetaDecoder can be served as a promising approach for effectively clustering metagenomic contigs. Conclusions In conclusion, we developed the GPU-based MetaDecoder for effectively clustering metagenomic contigs and reconstructing microbial communities from microbial data. Applying MetaDecoder on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that it could generate more complete clusters with lower contamination. Using MetaDecoder, we identified novel high-quality genomes and expanded the existing catalog of bacterial genomes. Video Abstract},

abstract = {Abstract Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and computational methods have added a new dimension to metagenomic data analysis i.e. genome-resolved metagenomics. In general terms, it refers to the recovery of draft or high-quality microbial genomes and their taxonomic classification and functional annotation. In recent years, several studies have utilized the genome-resolved metagenome analysis approach and identified previously unknown microbial species from human and environmental metagenomes. In this review, we describe genome-resolved metagenome analysis as a series of four necessary steps: (i) preprocessing of the sequencing reads, (ii) de novo metagenome assembly, (iii) genome binning and (iv) taxonomic and functional analysis of the recovered genomes. For each of these four steps, we discuss the most commonly used tools and the currently available pipelines to guide the scientific community in the recovery and subsequent analyses of genomes from any metagenome sample. Furthermore, we also discuss the tools required for validation of assembly quality as well as for improving quality of the recovered genomes. We also highlight the currently available pipelines that can be used to automate the whole analysis without having advanced bioinformatics knowledge. Finally, we will highlight the most widely adapted and actively maintained tools and pipelines that can be helpful to the scientific community in decision making before they commence the analysis.},

Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.Draft prokaryotic genomes from faecal metagenomes of diverse human populations enrich our understanding of the human gut microbiome by identifying over two thousand new species-level taxa that have numerous disease associations.},

abstract = {Analysis of metagenome data based on the recovery of draft genomes (so called metagenome–assembled genomes, or MAG) have assumed an increasingly central role in microbiome research in recent years. Microbial communities underpinning the operation of wastewater treatment plants are particularly challenging targets for MAG analysis due to their high ecological complexity, and remain important, albeit understudied, microbial communities that play a key role in mediating interactions between human and natural ecosystems. In this paper, we consider strategies for recovery of MAG sequence from time series metagenome surveys of full–scale activated sludge microbial communities. We generate MAG catalogues from this set of data using several different strategies, including the use of multiple individual sample assemblies, two variations on multi–sample co–assembly and a recently published MAG recovery workflow using deep learning. We obtain a total of just under 9,100 draft genomes, which collapse to around 3,100 non–redundant genomic clusters. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in relation to MAG yield and quality, showing the co-assembly offers clear advantages over single–sample assembly. Around 1000 MAGs were candidates for being considered high quality, based on single–copy marker gene occurrence statistics, however only 58 MAG formally meet the MIMAG criteria for being high quality draft genomes. These findings carry broader implications for performing genome–resolved metagenomics on highly complex communities, the design and implementation of genome recoverability strategies, MAG decontamination and the search for better binning methodology.},

abstract = {Metagenomic binning is the step in building metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) when sequences predicted to originate from the same genome are automatically grouped together. The most widely-used methods for binning are reference-independent, operating de novo and allow the recovery of genomes from previously unsampled clades. However, they do not leverage the knowledge in existing databases. Here, we propose SemiBin, an open source tool that uses neural networks to implement a semi-supervised approach, i.e. SemiBin exploits the information in reference genomes, while retaining the capability of binning genomes that are outside the reference dataset. SemiBin outperforms existing state-of-the-art binning methods in simulated and real microbiome datasets across three different environments (human gut, dog gut, and marine microbiomes). SemiBin returns more high-quality bins with larger taxonomic diversity, including more distinct genera and species. SemiBin is available as open source software at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/.},

abstract = {Advancements in metagenomics sequencing allow the study of microbial communities directly from their environments. Metagenomics binning is a key step in the species characterisation of microbial communities. Next-generation sequencing reads are usually assembled into contigs for metagenomics binning mainly due to the limited information within short reads. Third-generation sequencing provides much longer reads that have lengths similar to the contigs assembled from short reads. However, existing contig-binning tools cannot be directly applied on long reads due to the absence of coverage information and the presence of high error rates. The few existing long-read binning tools either use only composition or use composition and coverage information separately. This may ignore bins that correspond to low-abundance species or erroneously split bins that correspond to species with non-uniform coverages. Here we present a reference-free binning approach, LRBinner, that combines composition and coverage information of complete long-read datasets. LRBinner also uses a distance-histogram-based clustering algorithm to extract clusters with varying sizes. The experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that LRBinner achieves the best binning accuracy against the baselines. Moreover, we show that binning reads using LRBinner prior to assembly reduces computational resources for assembly while attaining satisfactory assembly qualities. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Applied computing → Bioinformatics; Applied computing → Computational genomics},

abstract = {Background Metagenome sampling bias for geographical location and lifestyle is partially responsible for the incomplete catalog of reference genomes of gut microbial species. Thus, genome assembly from currently under-represented populations may effectively expand the reference gut microbiome and improve taxonomic and functional profiling. Methods We assembled genomes using public whole-metagenomic shotgun sequencing (WMS) data for 110 and 645 fecal samples from India and Japan, respectively. In addition, we assembled genomes from newly generated WMS data for 90 fecal samples collected from Korea. Expecting genome assembly for low-abundance species may require a much deeper sequencing than that usually employed, so we performed ultra-deep WMS (> 30 Gbp or > 100 million read pairs) for the fecal samples from Korea. We consequently assembled 29,082 prokaryotic genomes from 845 fecal metagenomes for the three under-represented Asian countries and combined them with the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) to generate an expanded catalog, the Human Reference Gut Microbiome (HRGM). Results HRGM contains 232,098 non-redundant genomes for 5414 representative prokaryotic species including 780 that are novel, > 103 million unique proteins, and > 274 million single-nucleotide variants. This is an over 10% increase from the UHGG. The new 780 species were enriched for the Bacteroidaceae family, including species associated with high-fiber and seaweed-rich diets. Single-nucleotide variant density was positively associated with the speciation rate of gut commensals. We found that ultra-deep sequencing facilitated the assembly of genomes for low-abundance taxa, and deep sequencing (e.g., > 20 million read pairs) may be needed for the profiling of low-abundance taxa. Importantly, the HRGM significantly improved the taxonomic and functional classification of sequencing reads from fecal samples. Finally, analysis of human self-antigen homologs on the HRGM species genomes suggested that bacterial taxa with high cross-reactivity potential may contribute more to the pathogenesis of gut microbiome-associated diseases than those with low cross-reactivity potential by promoting inflammatory condition. Conclusions By including gut metagenomes from previously under-represented Asian countries, Korea, India, and Japan, we developed a substantially expanded microbiome catalog, HRGM. Information of the microbial genomes and coding genes is publicly available (www.mbiomenet.org/HRGM/). HRGM will facilitate the identification and functional analysis of disease-associated gut microbiota.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Adaptation to life in the deep-sea can be dramatic, with fish displaying behaviors and appearances unlike those seen in any other aquatic habitat. However, the extent of which adaptations may have developed at a microbial scale is not as clear. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the intestinal microbiome of 32 species of deep-sea fish from across the Atlantic Ocean revealed that many of the associated microbes differ extensively from those previously identified in reference databases. 111 individual metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed representing individual microbial species from the microbiomes of these fish, many of which are potentially novel bacterial taxa and provide a window into the microbial diversity in this underexplored environment. These MAGs also demonstrate how these microbes have adapted to deep-sea life by encoding a greater capacity for several cellular processes such as protein folding and DNA replication that can be inhibited by high pressure. Another intriguing feature was the almost complete lack of genes responsible for acquired resistance to known antibiotics in many of the samples. This highlights that deep-sea fish microbiomes may represent one of few animal-associated microbiomes with little influence from human activity. The ability of the microbes in these samples to bioluminesce is lower than expected given predictions that this trait has an important role in their life cycle at these depths. The study highlights the uniqueness, complexity and adaptation of microbial communities living in one of the largest and harshest environments on Earth.},

abstract = {The gut microbiome is associated with human diseases and interacts with dietary components and drugs. In vivo mouse models may be effective for studying diet and drug effects on the gut microbiome. We constructed a mouse reference gut microbiome (MRGM, https://www.mbiomenet.org/MRGM/) that includes newly-assembled genomes from 878 metagenomes. Leveraging samples with ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing (>130 million read pairs), we demonstrated quality improvement in assembled genomes for mouse gut microbes as sequencing depth increased. MRGM provides a catalog of 46,267 non-redundant genomes with ≥70% completeness and ≤5% contamination comprising 1,689 representative bacterial species and 15.2 million non-redundant proteins. Importantly, MRGM significantly improved the taxonomic classification rate of sequencing reads from mouse fecal samples compared to previous databases. Using MRGM, we determined that reliable low-abundance taxa profiles of the mouse gut microbiome require sequencing >10 million reads. Despite the high overall functional similarity of the mouse and human gut microbiomes, only ~10% of MRGM species are shared with the human gut microbiome. Although ~80% of MRGM genera are present in the human gut microbiome, ~70% of the shared genera have <40% of core gene content for the respective genus with human counterparts. These suggest that although metabolic processes of the human gut microbiome largely occur in the mouse gut microbiome, functional translations between them according to genus-level taxonomic commonality require caution. Key Points MRGM provides 46,267 genomes comprising 1,689 bacterial species of mouse gut microbiome. Despite high overlap of genera, functional discrepancy between mouse and human gut microbiota is large. Lineage-specific markers underestimate the completeness of assembled genomes for uncharacterized taxa.},

abstract = {Human health and disease have increasingly been shown to be impacted by the gut microbiota, and mouse models are essential for investigating these effects. However, the compositions of human and mouse gut microbiotas are distinct, limiting translation of microbiota research between these hosts. To address this, we constructed the Mouse Gastrointestinal Bacteria Catalogue (MGBC), a repository of 26,640 high-quality mouse microbiota-derived bacterial genomes. This catalog enables species-level analyses for mapping functions of interest and identifying functionally equivalent taxa between the microbiotas of humans and mice. We have complemented this with a publicly deposited collection of 223 bacterial isolates, including 62 previously uncultured species, to facilitate experimental investigation of individual commensal bacteria functions in vitro and in vivo. Together, these resources provide the ability to identify and test functionally equivalent members of the host-specific gut microbiotas of humans and mice and support the informed use of mouse models in human microbiota research.},

Assessing marine microbial diversity is a crucial step towards understanding the global ocean. The waters surrounding Iceland are a complex environment where relatively warm salty waters from the Atlantic cool down and sink down to the deep. Microbial studies in this area have focused on photosynthetic micro- and nanoplankton mainly using microscopy and chlorophyll measurements. However, the diversity and function of the bacterial and archaeal picoplankton remains unknown. Here, we used a co-assembly approach supported by a marine mock community to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 31 metagenomes from the sea surface and seafloor of four oceanographic sampling stations sampled between 2015 and 2018. The resulting 219 MAGs include 191 bacterial, 26 archaeal and two eukaryotic MAGs to bridge the gap in our current knowledge of the global marine microbiome.},
