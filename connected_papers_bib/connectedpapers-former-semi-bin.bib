abstract = {Metagenomic binning is the step in building metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) when sequences predicted to originate from the same genome are automatically grouped together. The most widely-used methods for binning are reference-independent, operating de novo and allow the recovery of genomes from previously unsampled clades. However, they do not leverage the knowledge in existing databases. Here, we propose SemiBin, an open source tool that uses neural networks to implement a semi-supervised approach, i.e. SemiBin exploits the information in reference genomes, while retaining the capability of binning genomes that are outside the reference dataset. SemiBin outperforms existing state-of-the-art binning methods in simulated and real microbiome datasets across three different environments (human gut, dog gut, and marine microbiomes). SemiBin returns more high-quality bins with larger taxonomic diversity, including more distinct genera and species.

abstract = {Gut metagenomes from previously under-represented Asian countries, Korea, India, and Japan are developed to generate an expanded microbiome catalog, the Human Reference Gut Microbiome (HRGM), which suggested that bacterial taxa with high cross-reactivity potential may contribute more to the pathogenesis of gut microbiome-associated diseases than those with low cross- reactivity potential by promoting inflammatory condition. Background Metagenome sampling bias for geographical location and lifestyle is partially responsible for the incomplete catalog of reference genomes of gut microbial species. Thus, genome assembly from currently under-represented populations may effectively expand the reference gut microbiome and improve taxonomic and functional profiling. Methods We assembled genomes using public whole-metagenomic shotgun sequencing (WMS) data for 110 and 645 fecal samples from India and Japan, respectively. In addition, we assembled genomes from newly generated WMS data for 90 fecal samples collected from Korea. Expecting genome assembly for low-abundance species may require a much deeper sequencing than that usually employed, so we performed ultra-deep WMS (> 30 Gbp or > 100 million read pairs) for the fecal samples from Korea. We consequently assembled 29,082 prokaryotic genomes from 845 fecal metagenomes for the three under-represented Asian countries and combined them with the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) to generate an expanded catalog, the Human Reference Gut Microbiome (HRGM). Results HRGM contains 232,098 non-redundant genomes for 5414 representative prokaryotic species including 780 that are novel, > 103 million unique proteins, and > 274 million single-nucleotide variants. This is an over 10% increase from the UHGG. The new 780 species were enriched for the Bacteroidaceae family, including species associated with high-fiber and seaweed-rich diets. Single-nucleotide variant density was positively associated with the speciation rate of gut commensals. We found that ultra-deep sequencing facilitated the assembly of genomes for low-abundance taxa, and deep sequencing (e.g., > 20 million read pairs) may be needed for the profiling of low-abundance taxa. Importantly, the HRGM significantly improved the taxonomic and functional classification of sequencing reads from fecal samples. Finally, analysis of human self-antigen homologs on the HRGM species genomes suggested that bacterial taxa with high cross-reactivity potential may contribute more to the pathogenesis of gut microbiome-associated diseases than those with low cross-reactivity potential by promoting inflammatory condition. Conclusions By including gut metagenomes from previously under-represented Asian countries, Korea, India, and Japan, we developed a substantially expanded microbiome catalog, HRGM. Information of the microbial genomes and coding genes is publicly available (www.mbiomenet.org/HRGM/). HRGM will facilitate the identification and functional analysis of disease-associated gut microbiota.

abstract = {Drinking water contains phylogenetic diverse groups of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that affect the esthetic quality of water, water infrastructure, and public health. Taxonomic, metabolic, and ecological inferences of the drinking water microbiome depend on the accuracy, quality, and completeness of genomes that are reconstructed through the application of genome-resolved metagenomics. ABSTRACT Reconstructing microbial genomes from metagenomic short-read data can be challenging due to the unknown and uneven complexity of microbial communities. This complexity encompasses highly diverse populations, which often includes strain variants. Reconstructing high-quality genomes is a crucial part of the metagenomic workflow, as subsequent ecological and metabolic inferences depend on their accuracy, quality, and completeness. In contrast to microbial communities in other ecosystems, there has been no systematic assessment of genome-centric metagenomic workflows for drinking water microbiomes. In this study, we assessed the performance of a combination of assembly and binning strategies for time series drinking water metagenomes that were collected over 6 months. The goal of this study was to identify the combination of assembly and binning approaches that result in high-quality and -quantity metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), representing most of the sequenced metagenome. Our findings suggest that the metaSPAdes coassembly strategies had the best performance, as they resulted in larger and less fragmented assemblies, with at least 85% of the sequence data mapping to contigs greater than 1 kbp. Furthermore, a combination of metaSPAdes coassembly strategies and MetaBAT2 produced the highest number of medium-quality MAGs while capturing at least 70% of the metagenomes based on read recruitment. Utilizing different assembly/binning approaches also assists in the reconstruction of unique MAGs from closely related species that would have otherwise collapsed into a single MAG using a single workflow. Overall, our study suggests that leveraging multiple binning approaches with different metaSPAdes coassembly strategies may be required to maximize the recovery of good-quality MAGs. IMPORTANCE Drinking water contains phylogenetic diverse groups of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that affect the esthetic quality of water, water infrastructure, and public health. Taxonomic, metabolic, and ecological inferences of the drinking water microbiome depend on the accuracy, quality, and completeness of genomes that are reconstructed through the application of genome-resolved metagenomics. Using time series metagenomic data, we present reproducible genome-centric metagenomic workflows that result in high-quality and -quantity genomes, which more accurately signifies the sequenced drinking water microbiome. These genome-centric metagenomic workflows will allow for improved taxonomic and functional potential analysis that offers enhanced insights into the stability and dynamics of drinking water microbial communities.},

abstract = {Amazonian soil microbial communities are known to be affected by the forest-to-pasture conversion, but the identity and metabolic potential of most of their organisms remain poorly characterized. To contribute to the understanding of these communities, here we describe metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from 12 forest and pasture soil metagenomes of the Brazilian Eastern Amazon. We obtained 11 forest and 30 pasture MAGs (≥50% of completeness and ≤10 % of contamination), distributed among two archaeal and 11 bacterial phyla. The taxonomic classification results suggest that most MAGs may represent potential novel microbial taxa. MAGs selected for further evaluation included members of Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota, Desulfobacterota_B, Desulfobacterota_F, Dormibacterota, Eremiobacterota, Halobacteriota, Proteobacteria, and Thermoproteota, thus revealing their roles in carbohydrate degradation and mercury detoxification as well as in the sulphur, nitrogen, and methane cycles. A methane-producing Archaea of the genus Methanosarcina was almost exclusively recovered from pasture soils, which can be linked to a sink-to-source shift after the forest-to-pasture conversion. The novel MAGs constitute an important resource to help us unravel the yet-unknown microbial diversity in Amazonian soils and its functional potential and, consequently, the responses of these microorganisms to land-use change.},

abstract = {Ruminants are critical to global food security as they transform lignocellulosic biomass into high-quality protein products. The rumen microbes ferment feed to provide necessary energy and nutrients for the ruminant host. However, we still lack insight into the metabolic processes encoded by most rumen microbial populations. In this study, we implemented metagenomic binning approaches to recover 2,809 microbial genomes from cattle, sheep, moose, deer, and bison. By clustering genomes based on average nucleotide identity, we demonstrate approximately one-third of the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to represent species not present in current reference databases and rumen microbial genome collections. Combining these MAGs with other rumen genomic datasets permitted a phylogenomic characterization of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from 8,160 rumen microbial genomes, including the identification of 195 lanthipeptides and 5,346 diverse gene clusters for nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis. A subset of Prevotella and Selenomonas BGCs had higher expression in steers with lower feed efficiency. Moreover, the microdiversity of BGCs was fairly constant across types of BGCs and cattle breeds. The reconstructed genomes expand the genomic representation of rumen microbial lineages, improve the annotation of multi-omics data, and link microbial populations to the production of secondary metabolites that may constitute a source of natural products for manipulating rumen fermentation. Anderson and Fernando use metagenomic binning approaches to reconstruct 2,809 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes from ruminants, and perform phylogenomic analyses on the biosynthetic gene clusters from over 8,000 total rumen microbial genomes. These genomes provide insight into the relationship between microbial populations and the production of secondary metabolites that may be important for manipulating rumen fermentation.},

abstract = {Draft prokaryotic genomes from faecal metagenomes of diverse human populations enrich the understanding of the human gut microbiome by identifying over two thousand new species-level taxa that have numerous disease associations. The genome sequences of many species of the human gut microbiome remain unknown, largely owing to challenges in cultivating microorganisms under laboratory conditions. Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.Draft prokaryotic genomes from faecal metagenomes of diverse human populations enrich our understanding of the human gut microbiome by identifying over two thousand new species-level taxa that have numerous disease associations.},

Fourth, these sequence clusters, or bins, undergo rounds of quality assessment and refinement to yield MAGs. The optional fifth stage is dereplication of MAGs to select representatives. Next, each MAG is taxonomically classified. The optional seventh stage is assessing the fraction of diversity that has been recovered.

abstract = {Advancements in metagenomics sequencing allow the study of microbial communities directly from their environments. Metagenomics binning is a key step in the species characterisation of microbial communities. Next-generation sequencing reads are usually assembled into contigs for metagenomics binning mainly due to the limited information within short reads. Third-generation sequencing provides much longer reads that have lengths similar to the contigs assembled from short reads. However, existing contig-binning tools cannot be directly applied on long reads due to the absence of coverage information and the presence of high error rates. The few existing long-read binning tools either use only composition or use composition and coverage information separately. This may ignore bins that correspond to low-abundance species or erroneously split bins that correspond to species with non-uniform coverages. Here we present a reference-free binning approach, LRBinner, that combines composition and coverage information of complete long-read datasets. LRBinner also uses a distance-histogram-based clustering algorithm to extract clusters with varying sizes. The experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that LRBinner achieves the best binning accuracy against the baselines. Moreover, we show that binning reads using LRBinner prior to assembly reduces computational resources for assembly while attaining satisfactory assembly qualities. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Applied computing → Bioinformatics; Applied computing → Computational genomics},

Evaluation using mock communities revealed that BASALT auto-binning obtained up to 51% more number of MAGs with up to 10 times better MAG quality from microbial community at low (132 genomes) and medium (596 genomes) complexity, compared to other binners such as DASTool, VAMB and metaWRAP. Using BASALT, a case-study analysis of a Salt Lake sediment microbial community from northwest arid region of China was performed, resulting in 426 non-redundant MAGs, including 352 and 69 bacterial and archaeal MAGs which could not be assigned to any known species from GTDB (ANI < 95%), respectively.

Extensive experimental results over three large-scale simulated datasets and one real-world dataset demonstrate that MetaBinner outperforms other state-of-the-art individual binners and ensemble binners.

abstract = {A long-standing challenge in human microbiome research is achieving the taxonomic and functional resolution needed to generate testable hypotheses about the gut microbiota’s impact on health and disease. With a growing number of live microbial interventions in clinical development, this challenge is renewed by a need to understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic candidates. While short-read sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene has been the standard for microbiota profiling, recent improvements in the fidelity of long-read sequencing underscores the need for a re-evaluation of the value of distinct microbiome-sequencing approaches. We leveraged samples from participants enrolled in a phase 1b clinical trial of a novel live biotherapeutic product to perform a comparative analysis of short-read and long-read amplicon and metagenomic sequencing approaches to assess their utility for generating clinical microbiome data. Across all methods, overall community taxonomic profiles were comparable and relationships between samples were conserved. Comparison of ubiquitous short-read 16S rRNA amplicon profiling to long-read profiling of the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA amplicon showed that only the latter provided strain-level community resolution and insight into novel taxa. All methods identified an active ingredient strain in treated study participants, though detection confidence was higher for long-read methods. Read coverage from both metagenomic methods provided evidence of active-ingredient strain replication in some treated participants. Compared to short-read metagenomics, approximately twice the proportion of long reads were assigned functional annotations. Finally, compositionally similar bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from short-read and long-read metagenomic methods, although a greater number and more complete MAGs were recovered from long reads. Despite higher costs, both amplicon and metagenomic long-read approaches yielded added microbiome data value in the form of higher confidence taxonomic and functional resolution and improved recovery of microbial genomes compared to traditional short-read methodologies.},

To interrogate the taxonomic and functional differences between the human and mouse gut microbiotas, we developed the Mouse Microbial Genome Collection (MMGC), a compilation of 276 genomes from cultured isolates and 45,218 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 1,960 publicly available mouse metagenomes. The MMGC reveals that while only 2.65% of bacterial species are shared between mouse and human, over 80% of annotatable functions are present in both microbiomes. Using drug metabolism and butyrate synthesis as examples, we illustrate that although the species harbouring these key functions can differ between hosts, the MMGC enables identification of functionally equivalent taxa in the mouse and human microbiotas. The MMGC thereby facilitates the informed use of mice in biomedical research by providing access to the conservation and taxonomic locations of bacterial functions of interest.},

abstract = {Genome-resolved metagenomics has led to the discovery of previously untapped biodiversity within the microbial world. As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. ABSTRACT Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) represent individual genomes recovered from metagenomic data. MAGs are extremely useful to analyze uncultured microbial genomic diversity, as well as to characterize associated functional and metabolic potential in natural environments. Recent computational developments have considerably improved MAG reconstruction but also emphasized several limitations, such as the nonbinning of sequence regions with repetitions or distinct nucleotidic composition. Different assembly and binning strategies are often used; however, it still remains unclear which assembly strategy, in combination with which binning approach, offers the best performance for MAG recovery. Several workflows have been proposed in order to reconstruct MAGs, but users are usually limited to single-metagenome assembly or need to manually define sets of metagenomes to coassemble prior to genome binning. Here, we present MAGNETO, an automated workflow dedicated to MAG reconstruction, which includes a fully-automated coassembly step informed by optimal clustering of metagenomic distances, and implements complementary genome binning strategies, for improving MAG recovery. MAGNETO is implemented as a Snakemake workflow and is available at: https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bird_pipeline_registry/magneto. IMPORTANCE Genome-resolved metagenomics has led to the discovery of previously untapped biodiversity within the microbial world. As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. In this study, we compared commonly used assembly and binning strategies and assessed their performance using both simulated and real metagenomic data sets. We propose a novel approach to automate coassembly, avoiding the requirement for a priori knowledge to combine metagenomic information. The comparison against a previous coassembly approach demonstrates a strong impact of this step on genome binning results, but also the benefits of informing coassembly for improving the quality of recovered genomes. MAGNETO integrates complementary assembly-binning strategies to optimize genome reconstruction and provides a complete reads-to-genomes workflow for the growing microbiome research community.},

abstract = {Abstract The human gut microbiota performs functions that are essential for the maintenance of the host physiology. However, characterizing the functioning of microbial communities in relation to the host remains challenging in reference-based metagenomic analyses. Indeed, as taxonomic and functional analyses are performed independently, the link between genes and species remains unclear. Although a first set of species-level bins was built by clustering co-abundant genes, no reference bin set is established on the most used gut microbiota catalog, the Integrated Gene Catalog (IGC). With the aim to identify the best suitable method to group the IGC genes, we benchmarked nine taxonomy-independent binners implementing abundance-based, hybrid and integrative approaches. To this purpose, we designed a simulated non-redundant gene catalog (SGC) and computed adapted assessment metrics. Overall, the best trade-off between the main metrics is reached by an integrative binner. For each approach, we then compared the results of the best-performing binner with our expected community structures and applied the method to the IGC. The three approaches are distinguished by specific advantages, and by inherent or scalability limitations. Hybrid and integrative binners show promising and potentially complementary results but require improvements to be used on the IGC to recover human gut microbial species.},

abstract = {The gut microbiome is associated with human diseases and interacts with dietary components and drugs. In vivo mouse models may be effective for studying diet and drug effects on the gut microbiome. We constructed a mouse reference gut microbiome (MRGM, https://www.mbiomenet.org/MRGM/) that includes newly-assembled genomes from 878 metagenomes. Leveraging samples with ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing (>130 million read pairs), we demonstrated quality improvement in assembled genomes for mouse gut microbes as sequencing depth increased. MRGM provides a catalog of 46,267 non-redundant genomes with ≥70% completeness and ≤5% contamination comprising 1,689 representative bacterial species and 15.2 million non-redundant proteins. Importantly, MRGM significantly improved the taxonomic classification rate of sequencing reads from mouse fecal samples compared to previous databases. Using MRGM, we determined that reliable low-abundance taxa profiles of the mouse gut microbiome require sequencing >10 million reads. Despite the high overall functional similarity of the mouse and human gut microbiomes, only ~10% of MRGM species are shared with the human gut microbiome. Although ~80% of MRGM genera are present in the human gut microbiome, ~70% of the shared genera have <40% of core gene content for the respective genus with human counterparts. These suggest that although metabolic processes of the human gut microbiome largely occur in the mouse gut microbiome, functional translations between them according to genus-level taxonomic commonality require caution. Key Points MRGM provides 46,267 genomes comprising 1,689 bacterial species of mouse gut microbiome. Despite high overlap of genera, functional discrepancy between mouse and human gut microbiota is large. Lineage-specific markers underestimate the completeness of assembled genomes for uncharacterized taxa.},

The newly assembled genomes were enriched for members of the Bacteroidaceae family, including species associated with high-fiber and seaweed-rich diet. Single-nucleotide variant density was positively associated with the speciation rate of gut commensals. Ultra-deep sequencing facilitated the assembly of genomes of low-abundance taxa, and deep sequencing (>20 million read pairs) was needed for the profiling of low-abundance taxa. Importantly, the HRGM greatly improved the taxonomic and functional classification of sequencing reads from fecal samples. Finally, mapping homologous sequences for human auto-antigens onto the HRGM genomes revealed the association of commensal bacteria with high cross-reactivity potential with autoimmunity.

abstract = {Reconstructing microbial genomes from metagenomic short-read data can be challenging due to the unknown and uneven complexity of microbial communities. This complexity encompasses highly diverse populations which often includes strain variants. Reconstructing high-quality genomes is a crucial part of the metagenomic workflow as subsequent ecological and metabolic inferences depend on their accuracy, quality, and completeness. In contrast to microbial communities in other ecosystems, there has been no systematic assessment of genome-centric metagenomic workflows for drinking water microbiomes. In this study, we assessed the performance of a combination of assembly and binning strategies for time-series drinking water metagenomes that were collected over a period of 6 months. The goal of this study was to identify the combination of assembly and binning approaches that results in high quality and quantity metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), representing most of the sequenced metagenome. Our findings suggest that the metaSPAdes co-assembly strategies had the best performance as they resulted in larger and less fragmented assemblies with at least 85% of the sequence data mapping to contigs greater than 1kbp. Furthermore, a combination of metaSPAdes co-assembly strategies and MetaBAT2 produced the highest number of medium-quality MAGs while capturing at least 70% of the metagenomes based on read recruitment. Utilizing different assembly/binning approaches also assist in the reconstruction of unique MAGs from closely related species that would have otherwise collapsed into a single MAG using a single workflow. Overall, our study suggests that leveraging multiple binning approaches with different metaSPAdes co-assembly strategies may be required to maximize the recovery of good-quality MAGs, which more accurately capture the microbial diversity of drinking water samples.},

abstract = {Analysis of metagenome data based on the recovery of draft genomes (so called metagenome–assembled genomes, or MAG) have assumed an increasingly central role in microbiome research in recent years. Microbial communities underpinning the operation of wastewater treatment plants are particularly challenging targets for MAG analysis due to their high ecological complexity, and remain important, albeit understudied, microbial communities that play a key role in mediating interactions between human and natural ecosystems. In this paper, we consider strategies for recovery of MAG sequence from time series metagenome surveys of full–scale activated sludge microbial communities. We generate MAG catalogues from this set of data using several different strategies, including the use of multiple individual sample assemblies, two variations on multi–sample co–assembly and a recently published MAG recovery workflow using deep learning. We obtain a total of just under 9,100 draft genomes, which collapse to around 3,100 non–redundant genomic clusters. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in relation to MAG yield and quality, showing the co-assembly offers clear advantages over single–sample assembly. Around 1000 MAGs were candidates for being considered high quality, based on single–copy marker gene occurrence statistics, however only 58 MAG formally meet the MIMAG criteria for being high quality draft genomes. These findings carry broader implications for performing genome–resolved metagenomics on highly complex communities, the design and implementation of genome recoverability strategies, MAG decontamination and the search for better binning methodology.},

Human skin functions as a physical barrier to foreign pathogen invasion and houses numerous commensals. Shifts in the human skin microbiome have been associated with conditions ranging from acne to atopic dermatitis. Previous metagenomic investigations into the role of the skin microbiome in health or disease have found that much of the sequenced data do not match reference genomes, making it difficult to interpret metagenomic datasets. We combined bacterial cultivation and metagenomic sequencing to assemble the Skin Microbial Genome Collection (SMGC), which comprises 622 prokaryotic species derived from 7,535 metagenome-assembled genomes and 251 isolate genomes. The metagenomic datasets that we generated were combined with publicly available skin metagenomic datasets to identify members and functions of the human skin microbiome. The SMGC collection includes 174 newly identified bacterial species and 12 newly identified bacterial genera, including the abundant genus ‘ Candidatus Pellibacterium’, which has been newly associated with the skin. The SMGC increases the characterized set of known skin bacteria by 26%. We validated the SMGC metagenome-assembled genomes by comparing them with sequenced isolates obtained from the same samples. We also recovered 12 eukaryotic species and assembled thousands of viral sequences, including newly identified clades of jumbo phages. The SMGC enables classification of a median of 85% of skin metagenomic sequences and provides a comprehensive view of skin microbiome diversity, derived primarily from samples obtained in North America.

abstract = {The reconstruction of microbial genomes from large metagenomic datasets is a critical procedure for finding uncultivated microbial populations and defining their microbial functional roles. To achieve that, we need to perform metagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes. Despite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important property of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the metagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep Contrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can efficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and robust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add simulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to produce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the distorted data. Consequently, the trained model will be robust to noise and handle it implicitly during usage. CLMB outperforms the previous state-of-the-art binning methods significantly, recovering the most near-complete genomes on almost all the benchmarking datasets (up to 17% more reconstructed genomes compared to the second-best method). It also improves the performance of bin refinement, reconstructing 8-22 more high-quality genomes and 15-32 more middle-quality genomes than the second-best result. Impressively, in addition to being compatible with the binning refiner, single CLMB even recovers on average 15 more HQ genomes than the refiner of VAMB and Maxbin on the benchmarking datasets. On a real mother-infant microbiome dataset with 110 samples, CLMB is scalable and practical to recover 365 high-quality and middle-quality genomes (including 21 new ones), providing insights into the microbiome transmission.

This study performed the de novo metagenome assembly and recovery of the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) through genome binning (and refinement) of the contigs assembled from the zebrafish stool. The results indicate that majority of the MAGs had excellent quality i.e. high completeness (≥90%) and low contamination levels (≤5%). MAGs mainly belong to the taxa that are known to be members of the core zebrafish stool microbiome, including the phylum Proteobacteria, Fusobacteriota, and Actinobacteriota. However, most of the MAGs remained unclassified at the species level and reflected previously unexplored microbial taxa and their potential novelty. These MAGs also contained genes with predicted functions associated with diverse metabolic pathways that included carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism pathways. Lastly, we performed a comparative analysis of Paucibacter MAGs and reference genomes that highlighted the presence of novel Paucibacter species and enriched metabolic potential in the recovered MAGs.},

Yet, metabolic modeling efforts still tend to rely on reference genomes as the starting point for reconstruction and simulation of genome scale metabolic models (GEMs), neglecting the immense intra- and inter-species diversity present in microbial communities. Here we present metaGEM (https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM), an end-to-end highly scalable pipeline enabling metabolic modeling of multi-species communities directly from metagenomic samples. The pipeline automates all steps from the extraction of context-specific prokaryotic GEMs from metagenome assembled genomes to community level flux balance simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the metaGEM pipeline, we analyzed 483 samples spanning lab culture, human gut, plant associated, soil, and ocean metagenomes, to reconstruct over 14 000 prokaryotic GEMs. We show that GEMs reconstructed from metagenomes have fully represented metabolism comparable to the GEMs reconstructed from reference genomes. We further demonstrate that metagenomic GEMs capture intraspecies metabolic diversity by identifying the differences between pathogenicity levels of type 2 diabetes at the level of gut bacterial metabolic exchanges. Overall, our pipeline enables simulation-ready metabolic model reconstruction directly from individual metagenomes, provides a resource of all reconstructed metabolic models, and showcases community-level modeling of microbiomes associated with disease conditions allowing generation of mechanistic hypotheses.},

The gut is the richest ecosystem of microbes in the human body and has great influence on our health. Despite many efforts, the set of microbes inhabiting this environment is not fully known, limiting our ability to identify microbial content and to research it. In this work, we combine new microbial metagenomic assembled genomes from 51,052 samples, with previously published genomes to produce a curated set of 241,118 genomes. Based on this set, we procure a new and improved human gut microbiome reference set of 3594 high quality species genomes, which successfully matches 83.65% validation samples’ reads. This improved reference set contains 310 novel species, including one that exists in 19% of validation samples. Overall, this study provides a gut microbial genome reference set that can serve as a valuable resource for further research.},

abstract = {Abstract Microbial species play important roles in different environments and the production of high-quality genomes from metagenome data sets represents a major obstacle to understanding their ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Metagenome-Assembled Genomes Orchestra (MAGO) is a computational framework that integrates and simplifies metagenome assembly, binning, bin improvement, bin quality (completeness and contamination), bin annotation, and evolutionary placement of bins via detailed maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on multiple marker genes using different amino acid substitution models, next to average nucleotide identity analysis of genomes for delineation of species boundaries and operational taxonomic units. MAGO offers streamlined execution of the entire metagenomics pipeline, error checking, computational resource distribution and compatibility of data formats, governed by user-tailored pipeline processing. MAGO is an open-source-software package released in three different ways, as a singularity image and a Docker container for HPC purposes as well as for running MAGO on a commodity hardware, and a virtual machine for gaining a full access to MAGO underlying structure and source code. MAGO is open to suggestions for extensions and is amenable for use in both research and teaching of genomics and molecular evolution of genomes assembled from small single-cell projects or large-scale and complex environmental metagenomes.},

abstract = {Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. Loss of gut microbial diversity1–6 in industrial populations is associated with chronic diseases7, underscoring the importance of studying our ancestral gut microbiome. However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000–2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.},

abstract = {A novel clustering algorithm, MetaDecoder, which can classify metagenomic contigs based on the frequencies of k -mers and coverages and identify novel high-quality genomes and expand the existing catalog of bacterial genomes is introduced. Background Clustering the metagenomic contigs into potential genomes is a key step to investigate the functional roles of microbial populations. Existing algorithms have achieved considerable success with simulated or real sequencing datasets. However, accurately classifying contigs from complex metagenomes is still a challenge. Results We introduced a novel clustering algorithm, MetaDecoder, which can classify metagenomic contigs based on the frequencies of k -mers and coverages. MetaDecoder was built as a two-layer model with the first layer being a GPU-based modified Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM), which controls the weight of each DPGMM cluster to avoid over-segmentation by dynamically dissolving contigs in small clusters and reassigning them to the remaining clusters. The second layer comprises a semi-supervised k -mer frequency probabilistic model and a modified Gaussian mixture model for modeling the coverage based on single copy marker genes. Benchmarks on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that MetaDecoder can be served as a promising approach for effectively clustering metagenomic contigs. Conclusions In conclusion, we developed the GPU-based MetaDecoder for effectively clustering metagenomic contigs and reconstructing microbial communities from microbial data. Applying MetaDecoder on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that it could generate more complete clusters with lower contamination. Using MetaDecoder, we identified novel high-quality genomes and expanded the existing catalog of bacterial genomes. Video Abstract},

The reconstruction of bacterial and archaeal genomes from shotgun metagenomes has enabled insights into the ecology and evolution of environmental and host-associated microbiomes. Here we applied this approach to >10,000 metagenomes collected from diverse habitats covering all of Earth’s continents and oceans, including metagenomes from human and animal hosts, engineered environments, and natural and agricultural soils, to capture extant microbial, metabolic and functional potential. This comprehensive catalog includes 52,515 metagenome-assembled genomes representing 12,556 novel candidate species-level operational taxonomic units spanning 135 phyla. The catalog expands the known phylogenetic diversity of bacteria and archaea by 44% and is broadly available for streamlined comparative analyses, interactive exploration, metabolic modeling and bulk download. We demonstrate the utility of this collection for understanding secondary-metabolite biosynthetic potential and for resolving thousands of new host linkages to uncultivated viruses. This resource underscores the value of genome-centric approaches for revealing genomic properties of uncultivated microorganisms that affect ecosystem processes.},

Here we present the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection, a resource combining 286,997 genomes representing 4,644 prokaryotic species from the human gut. These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

The composition of the human gut microbiota is linked to health and disease, but knowledge of individual microbial species is needed to decipher their biological roles. Despite extensive culturing and sequencing efforts, the complete bacterial repertoire of the human gut microbiota remains undefined. Here we identify 1,952 uncultured candidate bacterial species by reconstructing 92,143 metagenome-assembled genomes from 11,850 human gut microbiomes. These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature. Our work expands the known diversity of uncultured gut bacteria, which provides unprecedented resolution for taxonomic and functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota.The known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota is substantially expanded with the discovery of 1,952 uncultured bacterial species that greatly improve classification of understudied African and South American samples.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key technologies used in proteomics. The majority of studies carried out using proteomics have focused on identifying proteins in biological samples such as human plasma to pin down prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers associated with particular conditions or diseases. This study aims to quantify microbial (viral and bacterial) proteins in healthy human plasma. MS data of healthy human plasma were searched against the complete proteomes of all available viruses and bacteria. With this baseline established, the same strategy was applied to characterize the metaproteomic profile of different SARS-CoV-2 disease stages in the plasma of patients. Two SARS-CoV-2 proteins were detected with a high confidence and could serve as the early markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The complete bacterial and viral protein content in SARS-CoV-2 samples was compared for the different disease stages. The number of viral proteins was found to increase significantly with the progression of the infection, at the expense of bacterial proteins. This strategy can be extended to aid in the development of early diagnostic tests for other infectious diseases based on the presence of microbial biomarkers in human plasma samples.},
